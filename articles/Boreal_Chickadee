<i>Parus hudsonicus</i>
The <b>Boreal Chickadee</b> (<i>Poecile hudsonicus</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> bird in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_(bird)" title="Tit (bird)">tit</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> Paridae.
Adults are 12.5–14.5&nbsp;cm (4.9–5.7 in) long with a weight of 7–12.4 g (.24-.34 oz). They have grey-brown upperparts with a brown cap and greyish wings and tail; their face is mainly grey with white on the sides. Their underparts are white with brown on the flanks and a black throat. They have a short dark bill, short wings and a long notched tail.
Their breeding habitat is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">coniferous</a> woods in Canada, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> and the northern edges of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States" title="Contiguous United States">lower forty-eight United States</a>. They remain within their breeding range throughout the year, but sometimes move south in winter. Winter movements south of their range, however, appear to have become increasingly rare. They nest in a hole in a tree; the pair excavates the nest, using a natural cavity or sometimes an old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> nest. The pair remains together year round and may mate for life.
These birds forage on conifer branches or probe into the bark, eating mainly insects and seeds, which may be stored for later use. They often forage in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_species_feeding_flock" title="Mixed species feeding flock" class="mw-redirect">small flocks</a> including other small birds, especially in winter.
The call is a husky <i>tsik-a-dee-dee</i>, a variant on the call which gives chickadees their name.
Often, it is still placed in the genus <i>Parus</i> with most other tits, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MtDNA" title="MtDNA" class="mw-redirect">mtDNA</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_b" title="Cytochrome b">cytochrome <i>b</i></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequence" title="DNA sequence" class="mw-redirect">sequence</a> data and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphology</a> suggest that separating <i>Poecile</i> more adequately expresses these birds' relationships (Gill <i>et al.</i>, 2005). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> has been treating <i>Poecile</i> as a distinct genus for some time already. The genus name <i>Poecile</i> has often been treated as feminine (giving the species name ending <i>hudsonica</i>); however, this was not specified by the original genus author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Jakob_Kaup" title="Johann Jakob Kaup">Johann Jakob Kaup</a>, and under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature" title="International Code of Zoological Nomenclature">ICZN</a> the genus name must therefore be treated by default as masculine, giving the name ending <i>hudsonicus</i> (del Hoyo et al. 2007).
