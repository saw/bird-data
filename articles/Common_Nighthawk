Once aerial, with its buoyant but erratic flight, this bird is most conspicuous. The most remarkable feature of this aerial insectivore is its small beak belies the massiveness of its mouth. Some claim appearance similarities to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owls" title="Owls" class="mw-redirect">owls</a>. With its horizontal stance<sup id="cite_ref-TheSibley_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TheSibley-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and short legs, the Common Nighthawk does not travel frequently on the ground, instead preferring to perch horizontally, parallel to branches, on posts, on the ground or on a roof.<sup id="cite_ref-ManitobaAvian_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ManitobaAvian-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The males of this species may roost together but the bird is primarily solitary.

Within family <i>Caprimulgidae</i>, subfamily <i>Chordeilinae</i> (Nighthawks) are limited to the New World and are distinguished from the subfamily <i>Caprimulginae</i>, by the lack of rictal bristles.
The American Orinthologists’ Union treated the smaller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antillean_Nighthawk" title="Antillean Nighthawk">Antillean Nighthawk</a> as conspecific with the Common Nighthawk until 1982.<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Up until the early 19th century, the Common Nighthawk and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip-poor-will" title="Whip-poor-will" class="mw-redirect">Whip-poor-will</a> were thought to be one species. The latter’s call was explained as the nocturnal expression of the Common Nighthawk. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Wilson" title="Alexander Wilson">Alexander Wilson</a>, “The Father of American Ornithology” correctly made the differentiation between the two species.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, because they held the title of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawk</a>" in their names, had habits of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnality" title="Diurnality">diurnal</a> insect hunting, and the fact that they travelled in migrating flocks, worked against these birds in that they were hunted for sport, nourishment and as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator" class="mw-redirect">predators</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Elphick_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Elphick-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Common Nighthawk is distinct from other <i>caprimulguids</i> with its showing of a forked tail (includes a white bar in females); long, unbarred, pointed wings with a distinguished white patch; the lack of rictal bristles, and the key identifier&nbsp;– their unmistakable calls.<sup id="cite_ref-Holyoak_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Holyoak-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> These birds range from 21 to 25 cm (8.3 to 9.8 in) in total length and from 51 to 61 cm (20 to 24 in) in wingspan.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Body mass can vary from 55 to 98 g (1.9 to 3.5 oz). Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 17.2 to 21.3 cm (6.8 to 8.4 in), the tail is 13 to 15.1 cm (5.1 to 5.9 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 0.5 to 0.8 cm (0.20 to 0.31 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 1.2 to 1.6 cm (0.47 to 0.63 in).<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Common Nighthawk resembles both the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antillean_Nighthawk" title="Antillean Nighthawk">Antillean Nighthawk</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Nighthawk" title="Lesser Nighthawk">Lesser Nighthawk</a>. The Lesser Nighthawk is a smaller bird and displays more buffy on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertail_covert" title="Undertail covert" class="mw-redirect">undertail coverts</a>, where the Common Nighthawk shows white. Common Nighthawks and Antillean Nighthawks exhibit entirely dark on the basal portion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_feather" title="Primary feather" class="mw-redirect">primary feathers</a>, whereas Lesser Nighthawks have bands of buffy spots. Common Nighthawks and Antillean Nighthawks have a longer, outermost primary conveying a pointier wing tip than the Lesser Nighthawk. The Common Nighthawk forages higher above ground than the Lesser Nighthawk and has a different call. The Antillean Nighthawk may only be distinguished as different from the Common Nighthawk, once in the hand. Subtle differences are recorded to be a challenge in field identification.<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Common Nighthawk may be found in forests, desert, savannahs, beach and desert scrub, cities,<sup id="cite_ref-TheSibley_3-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TheSibley-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and prairies,<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> at elevations of sea level or below to 12000&nbsp;ft / 3600&nbsp;m .<sup id="cite_ref-TheSibley_3-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TheSibley-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> They are one of a handful of birds that are known to inhabit recently burned forests, and then dwindle in numbers, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_succession" title="Ecological succession">successional</a> growth occurs over the succeeding years or decades. The Common Nighthawk is drawn into urban built-up areas by insects.<sup id="cite_ref-ManitobaAvian_5-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ManitobaAvian-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Common Nighthawk is the only Nighthawk occurring over the majority of northern North America.
Food availability is likely a key factor in determining which and when areas are suitable for habitation. The Common Nighthawk is not well designed to survive in poor conditions, specifically low food availability. Therefore, a constant food supply consistent with warmer temperatures is a driving force for migration and ultimately survival.
It is thought that the bird is not able to enter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpor" title="Torpor">torpor</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> although recent evidence suggests the opposite.<sup id="cite_ref-Holyoak_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Holyoak-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
Journey length 2500–6800&nbsp;miles / 4000–11000&nbsp;km.
The Common Nighthawk will migrate by day or night in loose flocks; frequently numbering in the thousands,<sup id="cite_ref-Elphick_6-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Elphick-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> no visible leader has been observed. The enormous distance travelled between breeding grounds and wintering range displays one of the North America’s longer migrations. The north bound journey commences at the end of February and the birds reach destinations as late as mid June. The south bound migration commences mid July and reaches a close in early October.<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
While migrating, these birds have been reported travelling through middle America, Florida, the West Indies,<sup id="cite_ref-Elphick_6-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Elphick-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Cuba, the Caribbean and Bermuda,<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> finally completing their journey in the wintering grounds of South America,<sup id="cite_ref-Elphick_6-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Elphick-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Holyoak_7-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Holyoak-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> primarily Argentina.<sup id="cite_ref-Holyoak_7-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Holyoak-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
As aerial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivore" title="Insectivore">insectivores</a>, the migrants will feed on route,<sup id="cite_ref-Elphick_6-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Elphick-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> congregating to hunt in marshes, rivers and on lakeshores. In Manitoba and Ontario, Canada, it is reported that during migration the Nighthawks are seen most commonly in the late afternoon, into the evening,<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ManitobaAvian_5-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ManitobaAvian-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> with a burst of sunset feeding activities.<sup id="cite_ref-ManitobaAvian_5-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ManitobaAvian-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Additionally, it has been noted that during migration the birds may fly closer to the ground than normal; possibly foraging for insects. There is speculation that feeding also occurs at higher altitudes.
The Common Nighthawk winters in southern South America, but distribution in this range is poorly known due to difficulties in distinguishing the bird from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Nighthawk" title="Lesser Nighthawk">Lesser Nighthawk</a> and in differentiating between migrants and over wintering birds. In some South and Central American countries, a lack of study has led to restricted and incomplete records of the bird. Records do support wintering in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina.<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
In the Common Nighthawk all bodily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectrice" title="Rectrice" class="mw-redirect">rectrices</a> are replaced in the post-juvenile <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moult" title="Moult" class="mw-redirect">moult</a>. Post-juvenile moult commences in September at the breeding grounds; majority of the body plumage is replaced but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing-coverts" title="Wing-coverts" class="mw-redirect">wing-coverts</a> and rectrices are not completed until January–February, once the bird arrives at the wintering grounds. There is no other moult prior to the annual moult of the adult. The Common Nighthawk adults have a complete moult that occurs mostly or completely on wintering grounds and is not ceased until January or February.<sup id="cite_ref-Holyoak_7-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Holyoak-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
No differences between calls or song in the Common Nighthawk. The most conspicuous vocalization is a nasal peent or beernt during even flight. Peak vocalizations are reported 30–45 minutes after sunset.
Croaking auk auk auk vocalized by males while in the presence of a female during courtship. Another courtship sound, thought to be made solely by the males, is the boom, created by air rushing through the primaries after a quick down flex of the wings during a daytime dive.
Hissing cluck heard by females, and wing-clapping by male during nest defence. Strongly territorial males perform dives against fledglings, females and intruders such as humans or raccoons.<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Frequent flyers, the long-winged Common Nighthawk hunts on the wing<sup id="cite_ref-Holyoak_7-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Holyoak-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> for extended periods at high altitudes or in open areas.<sup id="cite_ref-ManitobaAvian_5-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ManitobaAvian-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Crepuscular, flying insects are its preferred food source. Cessation of the hunt as dusk becomes night, resumes when night becomes dawn.<sup id="cite_ref-Holyoak_7-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Holyoak-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Nighttime (darkness) feeding is rare,<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> even on evenings with a full moon.<sup id="cite_ref-Holyoak_7-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Holyoak-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The bird displays opportunistic feeding tendencies, although it may be able to fine-tune its meal choice in the moments before capture.
Vision presumed to be main detection sense. No evidence exists to support the use of echolocation. The birds have been observed to converge on artificial light sources in an effort to forage for insects enticed by the light.<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The average flight speed of <b>Common Nighthawks</b> is 23.4 kilometers per hour.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Common Nighthawk was observed to drink on its winter range by flying extremely low over the surface of the water.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
No evidence suggests this bird casts pellets.
The Common Nighthawk is recognized to discharge feces around nest and roosting positions. The bird will sporadically defecate in flight. Defecation is pungent.<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Common Nighthawk breeds during the period of mid March to early October.<sup id="cite_ref-Elphick_6-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Elphick-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> It most commonly has a first and only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood" title="Brood">brood</a>, however sometimes a second later brood. The bird is assumed to breed every year. Reuse of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest" title="Nest">nests</a> by females in subsequent years has been reported.<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a> pattern has also recently been confirmed.<sup id="cite_ref-Holyoak_7-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Holyoak-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courting" title="Courting" class="mw-redirect">Courting</a> and mate selection occurs partially in flight, the male dives and booms (see Vocalization) in an effort to garner female attention,<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ManitobaAvian_5-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ManitobaAvian-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> the female may be in flight herself or stationary on the ground.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copulation" title="Copulation" class="mw-redirect">Copulation</a> occurs when the pair settles on the ground together; the male with his rocking body, widespread tail wagging and bulging throat expresses guttural croaking sounds.

The preferred breeding / nesting habitat is in forested regions with expansive rocky outcrops, in clearings, in burned areas<sup id="cite_ref-ManitobaAvian_5-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ManitobaAvian-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> or in small patches of sandy gravel.<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The eggs are not laid in a nest, instead laid on bare rock, gravel<sup id="cite_ref-ManitobaAvian_5-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ManitobaAvian-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> or sometimes a living substrate such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen" title="Lichen">lichen</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Least popular are breeding sites in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural" title="Agricultural" class="mw-redirect">agricultural</a> settings.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> As displayed in the latter portion of the 20th century, urban breeding is in decline.<sup id="cite_ref-ManitobaAvian_5-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ManitobaAvian-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> If urban breeding sites do occur; they are observed on flat, gravel rooftops.
It is a solitary nester putting great distances between other pairs of the same species, a nest would more commonly occur in closer proximity to other species of birds.
Females choose the nest site and are the primary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubators</a> of the eggs (males will incubate occasionally), incubation time varies but is approximately 18 days. The female will leave the nest unattended during the evening in order to feed. The male will roost in a neighbouring tree (the spot he chooses changes daily); he guards the nest by diving, hissing, wing-beating or booming at the sites. In the face of predation, Common Nighthawks do not abandon the nest easily; instead likely rely on their cryptic colouration to camouflage themselves. If a departure does occur the females have been noted to fly away, hissing at the intruder<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> or to perform a disturbance display.<sup id="cite_ref-Holyoak_7-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Holyoak-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> are elliptical shaped, strong, variably coloured with heavy speckling. The Common Nighthawk displays two, 6-7g, eggs per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)" title="Clutch (eggs)">clutch</a>; the eggs are laid over a period of 1–2 days. The female alone displays a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_patch" title="Brood patch">brood patch</a>.
The infants may be heard peeping in the hours before they hatch. Once the infants have broken out of the shells, there is a requirement to remove the debris in order to avoid predators. The mother may carry the eggshells to another location or consume a portion of them. Once hatched, the nestlings are active and have their eyes fully or half open, additionally they display a sparing cover of soft <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_feather" title="Down feather">down feathers</a>. The infants are semi<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial" title="Precocial">precocial</a>. By day 2, the hatchling’s bodily mass will double and they will be able to self propel towards their mothers call. The young will hiss at an intruder.
The young are fed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)" title="Regurgitation (digestion)">regurgitation</a> before sunrise and after sunset. The male parent will assist in feeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledglings</a> and will also feed the female during nesting. No records exist to support the parent’s ability to physically carry a chick.
On their 18th day, the young will make their first flight; by days 25-30, they are flying proficiently. The young are last seen with their parents on day 30. Complete development is shown between their 45-50th day. At day 52, the juvenile will join the flock, potentially migrating. Juvenile birds, in both sexes, are lighter in colour and have a smaller white wing-patch, than adult Common Nighthawks.<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
There has been a general decline in the number of Common Nighthawks in North America, but some population increases also have occurred <sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> in other geographical locations.<sup id="cite_ref-Holyoak_7-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Holyoak-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The bird’s large range makes individual risk thresholds in specific regions difficult to establish.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Common Nighthawk’s trait of being a ground nesting bird makes it particularly susceptible to predators some of which include domestic cats, ravens, snakes, dogs, coyotes, falcons and owls.
Lack of flat roofs, pesticides,<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> increased predation and loss of habitat<sup id="cite_ref-Holyoak_7-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Holyoak-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> are noted factors of their decline. Further, unstudied potential causes of decline include climate change, disease, road kills, man-made towers (as an aerial hazard) and parasites.<sup id="cite_ref-Poulin_4-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Poulin-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The absence of flat roofs (made with gravel) in urban settings is an important cause of decline.
