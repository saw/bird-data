The <b>Nashville Warbler</b>, <i>Oreothlypis ruficapilla</i>, is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbird</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_warbler" title="New World warbler">New World warbler</a> family.
They have olive-brown upperparts, a white belly and a yellow throat and breast; they have a white eye ring, no wing bars and a thin pointed bill. Adult males have a grey head with a rusty crown patch (often not visible); females and immature birds have a duller olive-grey head. The Nashville Warbler is closely related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia%27s_Warbler" title="Virginia's Warbler">Virginia's Warbler</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy%27s_Warbler" title="Lucy's Warbler">Lucy's Warbler</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colima_Warbler" title="Colima Warbler">Colima Warbler</a>, the four sharing generally similar plumage.
Two discrete populations exist. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies#Nominate_subspecies_and_subspecies_autonyms" title="Subspecies">nominate subspecies</a>, <i>O. r. ruficapilla</i>, breeds in northeastern North America. The other, <i>O. r. ridgwayi</i>, known as <b>Calaveras Warbler</b>, nests in western North America. The latter differs from the former in its relatively duller plumage and more persistent tail movements.
Nashville warblers breed in open mixed woods and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog" title="Bog">bog</a> habitats in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the northeastern and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States of America</a>. They conceal their open cup-shaped nests on the ground under shrubs.
They <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to southernmost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> in winter.
They forage in the lower parts of trees and shrubs, frequently flicking their tails; these birds mainly eat insects.
The song of the nominate subspecies consists of a rapid <i>seewit-seewit-seewit-ti-ti-ti</i>. Males sing from open perches on the nesting territory. The call sounds like a high <i>seet</i>. Western birds of the race <i>ridgwayi</i> have a slightly lower-pitched, richer song, and a sharper call note.
Although named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee" title="Nashville, Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, the Nashville Warbler only visits that area during migration.
