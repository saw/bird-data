The <b>Whiskered Auklet</b> (<i>Aethia pygmaea</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auk" title="Auk">auk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a>. It has a more restricted range than other members of its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a>, <i>Aethia</i>, living only around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleutian_Islands" title="Aleutian Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> and on some islands off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a> (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Islands" title="Commander Islands">Commander Islands</a>), and breeding on these islands. It is one of the smallest alcids, only the closely related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Auklet" title="Least Auklet">Least Auklet</a> being smaller. Its name is derived from the long white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">feathers</a> on its face that are part of its breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a>.
The Whiskered Auklet is a poorly studied species and much research needs to be undertaken on the species. It was originally described as two different species, from specimens collected at different ends of its range, however research has shown that it is a single species with clinal variation along its range. It is not thought to undertake <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migration</a>, but instead attends its breeding islands year round. Whiskered Auklets lay a single egg in a rocky crevice, in loose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird_colony" title="Seabird colony" class="mw-redirect">colonies</a> with other Whiskered Auklets and also other colonial seabirds. Both parents take part in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubation</a> and chick rearing. The whiskers have been shown to help them sense their way to and out of their nests at night.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Whiskered Auklets feed in the inshore zone, usually within 16&nbsp;km of land, where tidal currents concentrate their prey into dense swarms. They feed predominantly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copepod" title="Copepod">copepods</a> during the summer months, mostly on the species <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Neocalanus_plumchrus&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Neocalanus plumchrus (page does not exist)">Neocalanus plumchrus</a></i>; and switching to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphausiid" title="Euphausiid" class="mw-redirect">euphausiid</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill" title="Krill">krill</a> in the fall and winter.
