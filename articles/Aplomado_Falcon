The <b>Aplomado Falcon</b> (<i>Falco femoralis</i>) is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon" title="Falcon">falcon</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americas" title="The Americas" class="mw-redirect">the Americas</a>. The species' largest contiguous range is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, but not in the deep interior <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Basin" title="Amazon Basin">Amazon Basin</a>. It was long known as <i>Falco fusco-coerulescens</i> or <i>Falco fuscocaerulescens</i>, but these names are now believed to refer to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_Falcon" title="Bat Falcon">Bat Falcon</a> (<i>F. rufigularis</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Its resemblance in shape to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby_(bird)" title="Hobby (bird)">hobbies</a> accounts for its old name <b>Orange-chested Hobby</b>. <i>Aplomado</i> is an unusual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_(language)" title="Spanish (language)" class="mw-redirect">Spanish</a> word for "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a>-colored", referring to the blue-grey areas of the plumage – an approximate English translation would be "leaden falcon". Spanish names for the species include <i><b>halcón aplomado</b></i> and <i><b>halcón fajado</b></i> (roughly "banded falcon" in reference to the characteristic pattern); in Brazil it is known as <i><b>falcão-de-coleira</b></i>.
The Aplomado Falcon is very slender, long-winged, and long-tailed, the size of a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_Falcon" title="Peregrine Falcon">Peregrine Falcon</a> (<i>F. peregrinus</i>), at 12–16 in (30–40&nbsp;cm) long and with an average wingspan of about 36 in (90&nbsp;cm), but only half the weight, at about 7.3–10.8 oz (208–305 g) in males and 9.6–16 oz (271–460 g) in females.<sup id="cite_ref-gmj2006_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gmj2006-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In adult birds, the upperparts are dark blue-grey, as is much of the head, with the usual falcon "moustache" contrasting sharply with the white throat and eyestripe. The upper breast continues the white of the throat; there are black patches on each side of the lower breast that meet in the middle; the belly and thighs, below the black patches, are light cinnamon. The tail is black with narrow white or grey bars and a white tip. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cere" title="Cere" class="mw-redirect">cere</a>, eye-ring, and feet are yellow or yellow-orange.<sup id="cite_ref-H.26W_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H.26W-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Except that females are bigger than males, the sexes are similar. Juvenile birds are very similar to adults, but their upperparts and belly band are blackish brown, the chest is streaked with black, the white on the head and breast is buffy, and the cinnamon on the underparts is paler, as are the feet.<sup id="cite_ref-H.26W_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H.26W-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species may be confused with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_Falcon" title="Bat Falcon">Bat Falcon</a> (<i>F. rufigularis</i>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange-breasted_Falcon" title="Orange-breasted Falcon">Orange-breasted Falcon</a> (<i>F. deiroleucus</i>), which have similar white-black-rust patterns below, but those species are built more like Peregrine Falcons and have solidly blackish heads and darker rufous bellies.<sup id="cite_ref-H.26W_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H.26W-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> These two species are generally considered to belong to the same lineage as the Aplomado Falcon. Two other <i>Falco</i> species of the Americas, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(bird)" title="Merlin (bird)">Merlin</a> (<i>F. columbarius</i>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Kestrel" title="American Kestrel">American Kestrel</a> (<i>F. sparverius</i>), seem to be closer to the Aplomado group than most other falcons, but the relationships of all these lineages are fairly enigmatic. All that can be said with some certainty is that they diverged as part of an apparently largely western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holarctic" title="Holarctic">Holarctic</a> radiation in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Miocene" title="Late Miocene">Late Miocene</a>, probably around <span class="nourlexpansion plainlinks" style="white-space: nowrap;"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://toolserver.org/~verisimilus/Timeline/Timeline.php?Ma=8–5">8&nbsp;to&nbsp;5</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_years_ago" title="Million years ago" class="mw-redirect">million years ago</a></span>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Aplomado Falcon's habitat is dry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland" title="Grassland">grasslands</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savannahs</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a>. It ranges from northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> locally to southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, but has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction" title="Local extinction">extirpated</a> from many places in its range, including all of northern and central Mexico except for a small area of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua_(state)" title="Chihuahua (state)">Chihuahua</a>. Globally, however, it is so widespread that it is assessed as Species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern" title="Least Concern">Least Concern</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
It feeds on large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> and small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a>, with small birds making up the overwhelming bulk of its prey. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-species_feeding_flock" title="Mixed-species feeding flock" class="mw-redirect">Mixed-species feeding flocks</a> in open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerrado" title="Cerrado">cerrado</a> and grassland will go on frenzied alert upon spotting this species; small birds fear it more than most other predators.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> It is often seen soaring at twilight hunting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and eating them on the wing.<sup id="cite_ref-H.26W_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H.26W-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> It also hunts at fields being burned, at which many birds of this species may gather; cooperation between individual Aplomado Falcons – usually members of a pair – has also been recorded. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, Aplomado Falcons have been observed following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maned_Wolf" title="Maned Wolf" class="mw-redirect">Maned Wolves</a> (<i>Chrysocyon brachyurus</i>) and chasing birds that the wolves flush.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Prey items typically weigh one-fifth to one-half of the falcons' own weight, but females of this species (which due to their size can tackle larger prey) have been recorded eating birds larger than themselves, such as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_Egret" title="Cattle Egret">Cattle Egret</a> (<i>Bulbucus ibis</i>) or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Chachalaca" title="Plain Chachalaca">Plain Chachalaca</a> (<i>Ortalis vetula</i>), on rare occasions.<sup id="cite_ref-gmj2006_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gmj2006-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The nest is a platform built of sticks at any height in a bush or tree. Two or three eggs are laid.<sup id="cite_ref-H.26W_4-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H.26W-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Until the 1950s it was found in the extreme southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, and reintroduction efforts are under way in Western and Southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>. It began to reoccupy its former range in West Texas and southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a> in the 1990s.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Documentary evidence for these naturally occurring birds was obtained in New Mexico in 1991, and sightings built steadily through that decade and the next, leading to successful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledging</a> of three young in 2002.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Sightings and nesting activity continue to the present.
The expansion of the reintroduction program to that area has met with criticism, because technically, all Aplomado Falcons in New Mexico are classified as part of the "experimental" (reintroduction) population.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> As such, while they are still legally protected from hunting, they are not protected by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act" title="Endangered Species Act">Endangered Species Act</a> requirements to preserve habitat and the like. It is believed that mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction">habitat destruction</a> caused the species' (near-)disappearance from the US and hinders reestablishment of a wild breeding population. A coalition of environmental groups is attempting to have full protection restored so as not to jeopardize the success of the expanding wild population and the reintroduction efforts.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
Similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(bird)" title="Merlin (bird)">Merlin</a>, the Aplomado Falcon will chase after game such as small birds and quail, by pursuit flight, which is flying after quarry flushed out. It is mainly acquired from breeders because of its scarcity in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, and many falconers in Europe will buy a pair for about £4000. It's admired for its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter" title="Accipiter">accipiter</a>-like hunting style, which has made the bird famous for being more like an accipiter than a falcon. This is also shown through its determination to catch the quarry even going into heavy cover. They are ideal for quail, doves, and will sometimes even go after squirrel or rabbits. Unfortunately, these birds are also known for carrying their game, like many small falcons, where they try and fly away from the falconer with their catch.
