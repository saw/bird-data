The <b>Common Raven</b> (<i>Corvus corax</i>), also known as the <b>Northern Raven</b>, is a large, all-black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> bird. Found across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_hemisphere" title="Northern hemisphere" class="mw-redirect">northern hemisphere</a>, it is the most widely distributed of all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvidae" title="Corvidae">corvids</a>. There are at least eight <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> with little variation in appearance—although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thick-billed_Raven" title="Thick-billed Raven">Thick-billed Raven</a>, and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the Common Raven averages 63&nbsp;centimetres (25 inches) in length and 1.2 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram" title="Kilogram">kilograms</a> (2.6&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)" title="Pound (mass)">pounds</a>) in mass. Common Ravens can live up to 21 years in the wild,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> a lifespan exceeded among passerines by only a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia" title="Australasia">Australasian</a> species such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satin_Bowerbird" title="Satin Bowerbird">Satin Bowerbird</a><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and probably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrebird" title="Lyrebird">lyrebirds</a>.

The Common Raven has coexisted with humans for thousands of years and in some areas have been so numerous that they are considered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism)" title="Pest (organism)">pest</a>. Part of its success comes from its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore" title="Omnivore">omnivorous</a> diet; Common Ravens are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion" title="Carrion">carrion</a>, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, and food waste.
Some notable feats of problem-solving have been observed in the species, leading to the belief that it is highly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligent</a>. Over the centuries, it has been the subject of mythology, folklore, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_depictions_of_ravens" title="Cultural depictions of ravens">art, and literature</a>. In many indigenous cultures, including those of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology" title="Norse mythology">Scandinavia</a>, ancient Ireland and Wales, Bhutan, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Pacific_Northwest_Coast" title="Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast">northwest coast of North America</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_Siberia" title="Indigenous peoples of Siberia">Siberia</a> and northeast Asia, the Common Raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or god.<sup id="cite_ref-Jones_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Jones-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>

The findings indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, Common Ravens from the rest of the United States are more closely related to those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and that Common Ravens in the California clade are more closely related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahuan_Raven" title="Chihuahuan Raven">Chihuahuan Raven</a> <i>(C. cryptoleucus)</i> than to those in the Holarctic clade.<sup id="cite_ref-USGS_22-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-USGS-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more closely related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Crow" title="Pied Crow">Pied Crow</a> <i>(C. albus)</i> than they are to the California clade.<sup id="cite_ref-Feld05_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Feld05-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> Thus, the Common Raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyletic" title="Paraphyletic" class="mw-redirect">paraphyletic</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Feld05_24-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Feld05-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup>
One explanation for these surprising genetic findings is that Common Ravens settled in California at least two million years ago and became separated from their relatives in Europe and Asia during an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age" title="Ice age">ice age</a>. One million years ago, a group from the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan Raven.

A recent study of raven <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA" title="Mitochondrial DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations.<sup id="cite_ref-Bakom06_26-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bakom06-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> The study did not include any individuals from the North African population,<sup id="cite_ref-Bakom06_26-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bakom06-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> and its position is therefore unclear, though its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphology</a> is very close to the population of the Canaries (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).<sup id="cite_ref-Clements_18-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Clements-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>
A mature Common Raven ranges between 56 and 78&nbsp;cm (22 to 30&nbsp;inches) in length, with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingspan" title="Wingspan">wingspan</a> of 100 to 150&nbsp;cm (40 to 59 in).<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> Recorded weights range from 0.69 to 2&nbsp;kg (1.5 to 4.4&nbsp;lb),<sup id="cite_ref-Boarman_Heinrich_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Boarman_Heinrich-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> thus making the Common Raven one of the heaviest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerines</a>.

Apart from its greater size, the Common Raven differs from its cousins, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow" title="Crow">crows</a>, by having a larger and heavier, black beak, shaggy feathers around the throat and above the beak, and a wedge-shaped tail.<sup id="cite_ref-observerbook_36-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-observerbook-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant <i>prruk-prruk-prruk</i> call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid.

One behavior is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens to a food bonanza, usually a carcass, with a series of loud yells. In <i>Ravens in Winter,</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernd_Heinrich" title="Bernd Heinrich">Bernd Heinrich</a> posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away.<sup id="cite_ref-Bernd89_60-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bernd89-60"><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup> A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit.<sup id="cite_ref-Heinrich.2C_B._1999_pp.C2.A0119.E2.80.93120_61-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Heinrich.2C_B._1999_pp.C2.A0119.E2.80.93120-61"><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup> Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent of the size of the bait.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62"><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup>
Due to its size, gregariousness and its defensive abilities, the Common Raven has few natural predators. Predators of its eggs include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marten" title="Marten">martens</a>, and other ravens. Ravens are quite vigorous at defending their young and are usually successful at driving off perceived threats. They attack potential predators by flying at them and lunging with their large bills, occasionally also using weapons such as small rocks which they drop on threatening animals while in flight. Humans are occasionally attacked if they get close to a raven nest, though serious injuries are unlikely. There are a few records of predation by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Eagle" title="Golden Eagle">Golden Eagles</a> and large owls such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Horned_Owl" title="Great Horned Owl">Great Horned Owls</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Eagle_Owl" title="Eurasian Eagle Owl" class="mw-redirect">Eurasian Eagle Owls</a>. Due to the fact that they are potential hazardous prey for raptorial birds, raptors usually must take them by surprise and most attacks are on fledgling ravens. More rarely still, large mammalian predators such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx" title="Lynx">lynxes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote" title="Coyote">coyotes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf" title="Wolf" class="mw-redirect">wolves</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar" title="Cougar">cougars</a> have also attacked ravens. This principally occurs at a nest site and when other prey for the carnivores are scarce. Ravens are highly wary around novel carrion sites and, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, have been recorded waiting for the presence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Crow" title="American Crow">American Crows</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Jay" title="Blue Jay">Blue Jays</a> before approaching to eat.<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63"><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup>
Juveniles begin to court at a very early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key behaviors of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location.<sup id="cite_ref-Oregon_50-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Oregon-50"><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in Common Ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.<sup id="cite_ref-Heinrich.2C_B._1999_pp.C2.A0119.E2.80.93120_61-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Heinrich.2C_B._1999_pp.C2.A0119.E2.80.93120-61"><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup>
Breeding pairs must have a territory of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources.

Like other corvids, Ravens can mimic sounds from their environment, including human speech.

Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. Non-vocal sounds produced by the Common Raven include wing whistles and bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If a member of a pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return.<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69"><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup>
The brains of Common Ravens count among the largest of any bird species.

Linguist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Bickerton" title="Derek Bickerton">Derek Bickerton</a>, building on the work of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Bernd_Heindrich&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bernd Heindrich (page does not exist)">Bernd Heindrich</a>, has recently argued that Ravens are one of only four known animals (the others beings <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee" title="Bee">bees</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ants</a>, and humans) who have demonstrated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(linguistics)" title="Displacement (linguistics)">displacement</a>, the capacity to communicate about objects or events that are distant in space or time from the communication. Young, unmated Common Ravens roost together at night, but usually forage alone during the day. However, when one discovers a large carcass guarded by a pair of adult Ravens, he will return to the roost and communicate his find. The next day, a flock of young Ravens will fly to the carcass, and chase off the adults. Bickerton argues that the advent of linguistic displacement was perhaps the most important event in the evolution of human language, and that Ravens are the only other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> to share this with humans.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71"><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup>
One experiment designed to evaluate insight and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-solving" title="Problem-solving" class="mw-redirect">problem-solving</a> ability involved a piece of meat attached to a string hanging from a perch. To reach the food, the bird needed to stand on the perch, pull the string up a little at a time, and step on the loops to gradually shorten the string. Four of five Common Ravens eventually succeeded, and "the transition from no success (ignoring the food or merely yanking at the string) to constant reliable access (pulling up the meat) occurred with no demonstrable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial-and-error" title="Trial-and-error" class="mw-redirect">trial-and-error</a> learning." This supports the hypothesis that Common Ravens are 'inventors'; that is, they have the ability to solve problems presented to them. Many of the Common Raven's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-solving" title="Problem-solving" class="mw-redirect">problem-solving</a> skills were formerly thought to be instinctive, but it is becoming clear that Common Ravens are actually quite intelligent.<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72"><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup>
