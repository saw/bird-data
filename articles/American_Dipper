The <b>American Dipper</b> (<i>Cinclus mexicanus</i>), also known as a <b>Water Ouzel</b>, is a stocky dark grey <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> with a head sometimes tinged with brown, and white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">feathers</a> on the eyelids cause the eyes to flash white as the bird blinks. It is 16.5&nbsp;cm long and weighs on average 46 g. It has long legs, and bobs its whole body up and down during pauses as it feeds on the bottom of fast-moving, rocky <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream" title="Stream">streams</a>. It inhabits the mountainous regions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>.
This species, like other dippers, is equipped with an extra eyelid called a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nictitating_membrane" title="Nictitating membrane">nictitating membrane</a>" that allows it to see underwater, and scales that close its nostrils when submerged. Dippers also produce more oil than most birds, which may help keep them warmer when seeking food underwater.
In most of its habits, it closely resembles its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> counterpart, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-throated_Dipper" title="White-throated Dipper">White-throated Dipper</a>, <i>Cinclus cinclus</i>, which is also sometimes known as a Water Ouzel. It feeds on aquatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and their larvae, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly" title="Dragonfly">dragonfly</a> nymphs, small crayfish, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddisfly" title="Caddisfly">caddisfly</a> larvae. It may also take tiny fish or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadpole" title="Tadpole">tadpoles</a>.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_song" title="Bird song" class="mw-redirect">song</a> consists of high whistles or trills <i>peee peee pijur pijur</i> repeated a few times. Both sexes of this bird sing year round. It defends a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_corridor" title="Wildlife corridor">linear territory</a> along streams. Its habit of diving and walking along the bottom of streams in search of food sometimes makes it the occasional prey of large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon" title="Salmon">salmon</a> or other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anadromous" title="Anadromous" class="mw-redirect">anadromous</a> fish.
The American Dipper's nest is a globe-shaped structure with a side entrance, close to water, on a rock ledge, river bank, behind a waterfall or under a bridge. The normal clutch is 2-4 white eggs, incubated solely by the female, which hatch after about 15–17 days, with another 20–25 days to fledging. The male helps to feed the young.
It is usually a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">permanent</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_bird" title="Resident bird" class="mw-redirect">resident</a>, moving slightly south or to lower elevations if necessary to find food or unfrozen water. The presence of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_species" title="Indicator species">indicator species</a> shows good water quality; it has vanished from some locations due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a> or increased silt load in streams.
There is at least one record of an American Dipper being eaten by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Varden_Trout" title="Dolly Varden Trout" class="mw-redirect">Dolly Varden Trout</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
