The <b>California Gull</b> <i>Larus californicus</i> is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gull</a>, smaller on average than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Herring_Gull" title="American Herring Gull">Herring Gull</a> but larger on average than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-billed_Gull" title="Ring-billed Gull">Ring-billed Gull</a>, though may overlap in size greatly with both.
Adults are similar in appearance to the Herring Gull, but have a smaller yellow bill with a black ring, yellow legs, brown eyes and a more rounded head. The body is mainly white with grey back and upper wings. They have black primaries with white tips. Immature birds are also similar in appearance to immature Herring Gulls, with browner plumage than immature Ring-billed Gulls. Length can range from 46 to 55 cm (18 to 22 in), the wingspan 122–137 cm (48–54 in) and body mass can vary from 430 to 1,045 g (0.95 to 2.30 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Their breeding habitat is lakes and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a> in interior western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territories" title="Northwest Territories">Northwest Territories</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> south to eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado" title="Colorado">Colorado</a> (Sibley 2000). They nest in colonies, sometimes with other birds. The nest is a shallow depression on the ground lined with vegetation and feathers. The female usually lays 2 or 3 eggs. Both parents feed the young birds.
They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, most moving to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Pacific</a> coast in winter. It is only then that this bird is regularly found in western California (Sibley 2000).
These birds forage in flight or pick up objects while swimming, walking or wading. They mainly eat insects, fish and eggs. They also scavenge at garbage dumps or docks. They may follow plows in fields for insects stirred up by this activity.
This is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_birds" title="List of U.S. state birds">state bird</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a>, remembered for assisting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon" title="Mormon" class="mw-redirect">Mormon</a> settlers in dealing with a plague of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_cricket" title="Mormon cricket">Mormon crickets</a>. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagull_Monument" title="Seagull Monument">monument</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City,_Utah" title="Salt Lake City, Utah" class="mw-redirect">Salt Lake City</a> commemorates this event, known as the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_Gulls" title="Miracle of the Gulls" class="mw-redirect">Miracle of the Gulls</a>".
There are two subspecies recognized, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominate_subspecies" title="Nominate subspecies" class="mw-redirect">nominate</a> from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Basin" title="Great Basin">Great Basin</a> to central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana" title="Montana">Montana</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, and the slightly larger, paler <i>L. c. albertaensis</i> with a more northerly distribution, ranging from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Slave_Lake" title="Great Slave Lake">Great Slave Lake</a> onto the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains" title="Great Plains">Great Plains</a> of western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota" title="South Dakota">South Dakota</a> (Jehl, 1987). Although these subspecies are not well distinguishable by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MtDNA" title="MtDNA" class="mw-redirect">mtDNA</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allozyme" title="Allozyme">allozyme</a> variation (Karl <i>et al.</i>, 1987), they breed true and the low genetic divergence can be explained by separation during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene" title="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> and renewed contact in Montana during more recent times (Jehl <i>et al.</i>, 1990).
In California, the California Gull recently held the protected status <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Species_of_Special_Concern" title="California Species of Special Concern" class="mw-redirect">California Species of Special Concern</a> due to declining numbers at their historic California breeding colony at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_Lake" title="Mono Lake">Mono Lake</a>. However, in recent decades this species has begun to breed in the southern portion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay" title="San Francisco Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>, where it did not historically breed, and has undergone exponential population growth. These California Gulls now inhabit large, remote salt-production ponds and levees and have a very large food source provided by nearby landfills from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco,_California" title="San Francisco, California" class="mw-redirect">San Francisco</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California" title="San Jose, California">San Jose</a> and other urban areas, all the way up into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California" title="Sacramento, California">Sacramento</a> area. The South Bay California Gull population has grown from less than 1,000 breeding birds in 1982 to over 33,000 in 2006. This population boom has resulted in large resident flocks of gulls that will opportunistically prey on other species, particularly the eggs and nestlings of other birds. Seriously threatened birds that share the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bay_(San_Francisco_Bay_Area)" title="South Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)">South Bay</a> habitat include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Plover" title="Snowy Plover">Snowy Plover</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Least_Tern" title="California Least Tern">California Least Tern</a>, while less-threatened birds including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-necked_Stilt" title="Black-necked Stilt">Black-necked Stilts</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Avocet" title="American Avocet">American Avocets</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forster%27s_Tern" title="Forster's Tern">Forster's Terns</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Tern" title="Caspian Tern">Caspian Terns</a> are also preyed upon by the abnormally large flocks of California Gulls. Efforts are underway to reduce habitat for this species and find other ways to disperse the large numbers of gulls. (Ackerman <i>et al.</i> 2006)
