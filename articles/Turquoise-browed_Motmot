The <b>Turquoise-browed Motmot</b> (<i>Eumomota superciliosa</i>) also called <b>Torogoz</b> by the inhabitants of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a> and <b>Guardabarranco</b> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>; is a colourful, medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motmot" title="Motmot">motmot</a> family, Momotidae. It inhabits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> from south-east <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> (mostly the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula" title="Yucat치n Peninsula">Yucat치n Peninsula</a>), to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>, where it is common and not considered threatened. It lives in fairly open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitats</a> such as forest edge, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_forest" title="Gallery forest">gallery forest</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrubland" title="Scrubland" class="mw-redirect">scrubland</a>. It is more conspicuous than other motmots, often perching in the open on wires and fences. From these perches it scans for prey, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile" title="Reptile">reptiles</a>. White <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a> (3-6) are laid in a long tunnel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> in an earth bank or sometimes in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarry" title="Quarry">quarry</a> or fresh-water well. Its name originates from the color of its brow, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turquoise" title="Turquoise">turquoise</a>.
The bird is approximately 34&nbsp;cm long and weighs about 65&nbsp;grams. It has a mostly green-blue body with a rufous back and belly. There is a bright blue stripe above the eye and a blue-bordered black patch on the throat. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remiges" title="Remiges" class="mw-redirect">flight feathers</a> and upperside of the tail are blue. The tips of the tail feathers are shaped like rackets and the bare feather shafts are longer than in other motmots. Although it is often said that motmots pluck the barbs off their tail to create the racketed shape, this is not true; the barbs are weakly attached and fall off due to abrasion with substrates and with routine preening.
Unlike most bird species, where only males express elaborate traits, the Turquoise-browed Motmot expresses the extraordinary racketed tail in both sexes. Research indicates that the tail has evolved to function differently for the sexes. Males apparently use their tail as a sexual signal, as males with longer tails have greater pairing success and reproductive success. In addition to this function, the tail is used by both sexes in a wag-display, whereby the tail is moved back-and-forth in a pendulous fashion. The wag-display is performed in a context unrelated to mating: both sexes perform the wag-display in the presence of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator" class="mw-redirect">predator</a>, and the display is thought to confer naturally selected benefits by communicating to the predator that it has been seen and that pursuit will not result in capture. This form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_communication#Interspecies_communication" title="Animal communication">interspecific communication</a> is referred to as a <a href="/w/index.php?title=Pursuit-deterrent_signal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pursuit-deterrent signal (page does not exist)">pursuit-deterrent signal</a>.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_song" title="Bird song" class="mw-redirect">call</a> is nasal, croaking and far-carrying.
The Turquoise-browed Motmot is a well-known bird in its range and has been chosen as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_bird" title="National bird" class="mw-redirect">national bird</a> of both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>. It has acquired a number of local names including <i>guardabarranco</i> ("ravine-guard") in Nicaragua, <i>torogoz</i> in El Salvador (based on its call) and <i>p치jaro reloj</i> ("clock bird") in the Yucat치n, based on its habit of wagging its tail like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum" title="Pendulum">pendulum</a>. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a> it is known as Momoto Cejiceleste.
