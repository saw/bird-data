<i>Leucophoyx thula</i>
The <b>Snowy Egret</b> (<i>Egretta thula</i>) is a small white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron" title="Heron">heron</a>. It is the American counterpart to the very similar Old World <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Egret" title="Little Egret">Little Egret</a>, which has established a foothold in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamas" title="Bahamas" class="mw-redirect">Bahamas</a>.
Adults are typically 61 centimetres (24&nbsp;in) long and weigh 3.75 kilograms (8.3&nbsp;lb) They have a slim black bill and long black legs with yellow feet. The area of the upper bill, in front of the eyes, is yellow but turns red during the breeding season, when the adults also gain recurved plumes on the back, making for a "shaggy" effect. The juvenile looks similar to the adult, but the base of the bill is paler, and a green or yellow line runs down the back of the legs.
Their breeding habitat is large inland and coastal wetlands from the lower <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> and southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>. The breeding range in eastern North America extends along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts from Maine to Texas, and inland along major rivers and lakes. They nest in colonies, often with other waders, usually on platforms of sticks in trees or shrubs. Their flat, shallow nests are made of sticks and lined with fine twigs and rushes. Three to four greenish-blue, oval eggs are incubated by both adults. The young leave the nest in 20 to 25 days and hop about on branches near the nest before finally departing.
In warmer locations, some Snowy Egret are permanent residents; northern populations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies" title="West Indies" class="mw-redirect">West Indies</a>. They may wander north after the breeding season, very rarely venturing to western Europe—the first bird sighted in Britain wintered in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> from 2001–2002.
The birds eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insects" title="Insects" class="mw-redirect">insects</a> and small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptiles" title="Reptiles" class="mw-redirect">reptiles</a>. They stalk prey in shallow water, often running or shuffling their feet, flushing prey into view, as well "dip-fishing" by flying with their feet just over the water. Snowy Egrets may also stand still and wait to ambush prey, or hunt for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> stirred up by domestic animals in open fields.
At one time, the beautiful plumes of the Snowy Egret were in great demand by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_hunters" title="Market hunters">market hunters</a> as decorations for women's hats. This reduced the population of the species to dangerously low levels.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from July 2012">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
Now protected in the USA by law, under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act_of_1918" title="Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act</a>, this bird's population has rebounded.
