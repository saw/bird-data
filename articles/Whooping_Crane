The <b>Whooping Crane</b> (<i>Grus americana</i>), is the tallest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> bird, is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered" title="Endangered" class="mw-redirect">endangered</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(bird)" title="Crane (bird)">crane</a> species named for its whooping sound. Along with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhill_Crane" title="Sandhill Crane">Sandhill Crane</a>, it is one of only two crane species found in North America. The Whooping Crane's lifespan is estimated to be 22 to 24 years in the wild. After being pushed to the brink of extinction by unregulated hunting and loss of habitat to just 21 wild and two captive Whooping Cranes by 1941, conservation efforts have led to a limited recovery. As of 2011, there are an estimated 437 birds in the wild and more than 165 in captivity.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
An adult Whooping Crane is white with a red crown and a long, dark, pointed bill. Immature Whooping Cranes are cinnamon brown. While in flight, their long necks are kept straight and their long dark legs trail behind. Adult Whooping Cranes' black wing tips are visible during flight.
The species can stand up to 1.5 meters (5&nbsp;feet) and have a wingspan of 2.3 meters (7.5&nbsp;feet). Males weigh on average 7.3&nbsp;kg (16&nbsp;lb), while females weigh 6.2&nbsp;kg (14&nbsp;lb) on average (Erickson, 1976).<sup id="cite_ref-features_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-features-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The body length averages about 132&nbsp;cm (52&nbsp;in).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The standard linear measurements of the Whooping cranes are a wing chord length of 53–63 cm (21–25 in), an exposed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmen_(bird)" title="Culmen (bird)" class="mw-redirect">culmen</a> length of 11.7–16 cm (4.6–6.3 in) and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> of 26–31 cm (10–12 in).<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The only other very large, long-legged white birds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> are: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Egret" title="Great Egret">Great Egret</a>, which is over a foot shorter and one-seventh the weight of this crane; the Great White Heron, which is a morph of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blue_Heron" title="Great Blue Heron">Great Blue Heron</a> in Florida; and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_Stork" title="Wood Stork">Wood Stork</a>.

Their calls are loud and can carry several kilometers wide. They express "guard calls" for warning their partner about any potential danger, the crane pair will jointly call ("unison call") in a very rhythmic and impressive way in the early morning (after waking up), after courtship and for defending their territory. The first unison call ever recorded in the wild was taken in the Whooping Cranes' wintering area in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aransas_National_Wildlife_Refuge" title="Aransas National Wildlife Refuge">Aransas National Wildlife Refuge</a> in December 1999 and is documented here <sup id="cite_ref-B._Wessling_www.craneworld.de_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-B._Wessling_www.craneworld.de-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>

They nest on the ground, usually on a raised area in a marsh. The female lays 1 or 2 eggs, usually in late-April to mid-May. The blotchy, olive-colored eggs average 2½ inches in breadth and 4&nbsp;inches in length (60 by 100&nbsp;mm), and weigh about 6.7 oz (190 g). The incubation period is 29–31 days. Both parents brood the young, although the female is more likely to directly tend to the young. Usually no more than one young bird survives in a season. The parents often feed the young for 6–8 months after birth and the terminus of the offspring-parent relationship occurs after about 1 year.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from October 2009">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Six Whooping Crane wintered on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_Lake" title="Granger Lake">Granger Lake</a> in Central TX in 2011/2012.

The Whooping Crane is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species" title="Endangered species">endangered</a> mainly as a result of habitat loss, although whoopers are also still illegally shot despite this being subject to substantial financial penalties and possible prison time.<sup id="cite_ref-cnn_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cnn-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wsfa_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wsfa-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-discovery_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-discovery-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
At one time, the range for these birds extended throughout midwestern North America. In 1941, the wild population consisted of 21 birds. Conservation efforts have led to a population increase; as of April 2007 there were about 340 Whooping Cranes living in the wild, and another 145 living in captivity.

While in earlier years, Whooping Crane chicks had been caught and banded (in the breeding areas of Wood Buffalo National Park), and it has delivered valuable insight into individual life history and behaviour of the cranes, this technique has been abandoned due to imminent danger for the cranes and the people performing the catching and banding activities.
By recording guard and unison calls followed by frequency analysis of the recording, a "voiceprint" of the individual crane (and of pairs) can be generated and compared over time. This technique was developed by B. Wessling and applied in the wintering refuge in Aransas and also partially in the breeding grounds in Canada over 5 years.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> It delivered interesting results, i.e. that besides a certain fraction of stable pairs with strong affinity to their territories, there is a big fraction of cranes who change partners and territories.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> Only one of the exciting results was to identify the "Lobstick" male when he still had his band; he later lost his band and was recognized by frequency analysis of his voice and then was confirmed to be over 26 years old, and still productive.
The Whooping Crane was declared endangered in 1967. Although believed to be naturally rare, the crane has suffered major population deprivations due to habitat destruction and over-hunting. The population has gone to an estimated 10,000+ birds before the settling of Europeans on the continent to 1,300-1,400 birds by 1870 to 15 adults by 1938. The current population is approximately 382.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
During the past two years, five Whooping Cranes in the Eastern population, which numbers about 100 in total, have been illegally shot and killed. One of the dead cranes was the female ("First Mom") who was the first captive raised and released whooper to successfully raise, along with her mate, a chick to adulthood in the wild in the East, in 2006. This was a particular blow to that population because whoopers in the East do not yet have an established successful breeding situation. Various agencies and individuals have offered rewards for the apprehension of the persons responsible.
Although the individuals responsible for the deaths of four of the cranes have not yet been apprehended, on March 30, 2011, Wade Bennett, 18, of Cayuga, Indiana and an unnamed juvenile pled guilty to killing First Mom. After killing the crane, the juvenile had posed holding up its body. Bennett and the juvenile were sentenced to a $1 fine, probation, and court fees of about $500, a penalty which was denounced by various conservation organizations as being too light. The prosecuting attorney has estimated that the cost of raising and introducing to the wild one Whooping Crane could be as much as $100,000.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup>
