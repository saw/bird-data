The <b>Tufted Titmouse</b> (<i>Baeolophus bicolor</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbird</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> in the tit and chickadee family (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paridae" title="Paridae" class="mw-redirect">Paridae</a>). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-crested_Titmouse" title="Black-crested Titmouse">Black-crested Titmouse</a>, found from central and southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> southwards, was included as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> but is now considered a separate species <i>B. atricristatus</i>.
These birds have grey upperparts and white underparts with a white face, a grey <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(feathers)" title="Crest (feathers)">crest</a>, a dark forehead and a short stout <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a>; they have rust-coloured flanks. The song is usually described as a whistled <i>peter-peter-peter</i>. They make a variety of different sounds, most having a similar tone quality.

They are all-year residents in the area effectively circumscribed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains" title="Great Plains">Great Plains</a>, the Great Lakes, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. The range is expanding northwards, possibly due to increased availability of winter food at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_feeder" title="Bird feeder">bird feeders</a>. The birds are nowadays resident all year even in rural <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> where there are few bird feeders, while it was noted around 1905 that many birds from these areas migrated south in winter.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
They forage actively on branches, sometimes on the ground, mainly eating insects, especially caterpillars, but also seeds, nuts and berries. They will store food for later use. They tend to be curious about their human neighbors and can sometimes be spotted on window ledges peering into the windows to watch what's going on inside. They are more shy when seen at bird feeders; their normal pattern there is to scout the feeder from the cover of trees or bushes, fly to the feeder, take a seed, and fly back to cover to eat it.

They line the nest with soft materials, sometimes plucking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair" title="Hair">hair</a> from a live animal such as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" title="Dog">dog</a>. If they find shed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_skin" title="Snake skin" class="mw-redirect">snake skin</a>, they will try to incorporate pieces of it in their nest.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Their eggs are under an inch long and are white or cream-colored with brownish or purplish spots. Sometimes, a bird born the year before remains to help its parents raise the next year's young. The pair may remain together and defend their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)" title="Territory (animal)">territory</a> year-round. These birds are permanent residents and often join small mixed flocks in winter. In rare cases, many birds may flock together to rest in a log or tree; some may even suffocate because so many birds are crowded inside of one cavity.
