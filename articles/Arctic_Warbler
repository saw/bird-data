The <b>Arctic Warbler</b> (<i>Phylloscopus borealis</i>) is a widespread <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_warbler" title="Leaf warbler">leaf warbler</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch" title="Birch">birch</a> or mixed birch forest near water throughout its breeding range in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fennoscandia" title="Fennoscandia">Fennoscandia</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. It has established a foothold in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, breeding in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>. This warbler is strongly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>; the entire population winters in southeast Asia. It therefore has one of the longest migrations of any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World" title="Old World">Old World</a> insectivorous bird.
It has traditionally included populations that breed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamchatka" title="Kamchatka" class="mw-redirect">Kamchatka</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuril_Islands" title="Kuril Islands">Kuril Islands</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics" title="Genetics">genetic</a> and vocal evidence strongly suggests these should be treated as separate species, with <i>P. examinandus</i> in Kamchatka, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido" title="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> and the Kuril Islands, and <i>P. xanthodryas</i> in Japan (except Hokkaido).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The nest is on the ground in a low shrub. Like most Old World warblers, this small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> is insectivorous.
This is a typical leaf warbler in appearance, greyish-green above and off-white below. Its single wing bar distinguishes it from most similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> except the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenish_Warbler" title="Greenish Warbler">Greenish Warbler</a>, <i>Phylloscopus trochiloides</i>. It is larger than that species and has a heavier, dagger-like bill, with a dark tip to the lower mandible. Its song is a fast trill.
This species occurs as an autumn vagrant in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and is annual in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>.
