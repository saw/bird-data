The upperparts, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather#Rectrices" title="Flight feather">rectrices</a> and undertail coverts are blackish-brown, as are at least the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal" title="Distal" class="mw-redirect">distal</a> undersides of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">remiges</a>, but sometimes the entire feathers. The rest of the underparts are white, as is the head below eye level. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" title="Iris (anatomy)">iris</a> is dark, the feet are dull pink with a black wash and black toenails,<sup id="cite_ref-em2001_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-em2001-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> and the bill is grey, darker towards the tip, and with a pinkish hue.<sup id="cite_ref-carboneras1992_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-carboneras1992-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
Males and females look alike. Immature birds do not have a distinct plumage, while the nestlings are covered with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_feather" title="Down feather">down feathers</a>, grey above and whitish on the belly.<sup id="cite_ref-carboneras1992_1-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-carboneras1992-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
It can be confused with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_Shearwater" title="Manx Shearwater">Manx Shearwater</a> (<i>P. puffinus</i>), which has white undertail coverts and in direct comparison a longer bill. Other similar-looking species are usually completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric_speciation" title="Allopatric speciation">allopatric</a>, though the largely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subantarctic" title="Subantarctic">subantarctic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Shearwater" title="Little Shearwater">Little Shearwater</a> (<i>P. assimilis</i>) may occasionally range into waters where <i>P. lherminieri</i> is normally found.

Its twittering calls and mewing are often only heard at night in the breeding colonies.
If not split into several species, Audubon's Shearwater ranges across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> north to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Sea" title="Arabian Sea">Arabian Sea</a>, throughout the northwest and central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Pacific</a>, in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, and parts of the eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic" title="Atlantic" class="mw-redirect">Atlantic</a>. It is a species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics" title="Tropics">tropical</a> waters; only some Atlantic populations and Bannerman's Shearwater of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogasawara_Islands" title="Ogasawara Islands" class="mw-redirect">Ogasawara Islands</a> occur farther north. Unlike the larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearwater" title="Shearwater">shearwaters</a>, adult Audubon's Shearwaters are not thought to wander much or undertake great migrations, although their young birds do so before breeding, and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> birds may gather in large numbers at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwelling" title="Upwelling">upwelling</a> zone in the Arabian Sea.<sup id="cite_ref-carboneras1992_1-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-carboneras1992-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
It is adaptable as regards its preferred marine habitat; it can be found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic" title="Pelagic" class="mw-redirect">pelagic</a>, offshore and inshore waters. It feeds in a variety of methods, mainly diving out of flight, plunging underwater from a swimming position, and picking up food less than a bill's length underwater while "pattering" as if it were walking across the waves. It eats small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid" title="Squid">squid</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton" title="Plankton">planktonic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>. Unlike other shearwaters, it is not commonly a ship-follower, though it may attend small fishing boats; it is also sometimes met with as part of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-species_feeding_flock" title="Mixed-species feeding flock" class="mw-redirect">mixed-species feeding flock</a>.&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref-carboneras1992_1-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-carboneras1992-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The species is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird#Seabird_colonies" title="Seabird">colonial</a>, nesting in small burrows and crevices in rocks and on earthy slopes on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoll" title="Atoll">atolls</a> and rocky islets. The breeding season varies according to location and subspecies, but how precisely is not very well-studied.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Both parents share the responsibility of incubating the single white egg (measurements of 52.5 by 36.2&nbsp;mm and a weight of 37 g have been recorded for one specimen of average size<sup id="cite_ref-em2001_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-em2001-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>), each incubating for periods of 2 to 10 days until the egg hatches after 49–51 days of incubation. The nestlings are brooded for half a week to one week, after which time the parents will leave it mostly alone in the burrow and spend most of their time foraging and feeding their voracious offspring, which become very fat. Time from hatching to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledging</a> is 62–75 days. Audubon's Shearwaters take about 8 years to reach breeding age. As typical for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procellariiformes" title="Procellariiformes">Procellariiformes</a> they are long-lived for their size, one bird <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_ringing" title="Bird ringing">ringed</a> as an adult was still alive 11 years later; it must have been more than 15 years old at that time.<sup id="cite_ref-carboneras1992_1-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-carboneras1992-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
While some small populations are threatened, the species as a whole (in the present sense, i.e. unsplit) is not considered to be globally threatened.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Audubon's Shearwater belongs to the <i>Puffinus sensu stricto</i> group of mid-sized and small shearwaters, which is related to the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calonectris" title="Calonectris">Calonectris</a></i>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy" title="Taxonomy">taxonomy</a> of this species is extremely confusing. It is occasionally listed as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> of <i>P. assimilis</i> (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Shearwater" title="Little Shearwater">Little Shearwater</a>), but they do not appear to be that closely related. Rather, <i>P. lherminieri</i> seems to belong to an ill-resolved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade" title="Clade">clade</a> also including such species as the Little Shearwater, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_Shearwater" title="Manx Shearwater">Manx Shearwater</a> (<i>P. puffinus</i>) or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-vented_Shearwater" title="Black-vented Shearwater">Black-vented Shearwater</a> (<i>P. opisthomelas</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The little-known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinroth%27s_Shearwater" title="Heinroth's Shearwater">Heinroth's Shearwater</a> (<i>P. heinrothi</i>) is sometimes considered a subspecies of either Audubon's or the Little Shearwater. Though it is likely to be another member of that close-knit group, its actual relationships remain uncertain due to lack of specimens.
Audubon's Shearwater itself has around 10 subspecies. Several have at one time or another been suggested to constitute separate species. For example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands" title="Galápagos Islands">Galápagos Islands</a> population has turned out to be a very distinct species, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Shearwater" title="Galápagos Shearwater">Galápagos Shearwater</a> (<i>P. subalaris</i>); it is apparently related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Shearwater" title="Christmas Shearwater">Christmas Shearwater</a> (<i>P. nativitatis</i>) and together with it constitutes an ancient lineage without other close relatives in the genus.<sup id="cite_ref-austinetal2004_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-austinetal2004-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Other taxa were initially assigned to the Little Shearwater and later moved to Audubon's. Analysis of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MtDNA" title="MtDNA" class="mw-redirect">mtDNA</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_b" title="Cytochrome b">cytochrome <i>b</i></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequence" title="DNA sequence" class="mw-redirect">sequence</a> data<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> – which is of somewhat limited value in procellariiform birds however<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> – indicates that at least 3 major <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade" title="Clade">clades</a> can be distinguished:
The former two have more white on the face and bluish feet like the Little Shearwater, with which they were formerly placed<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Many taxonomists consider both Boyd's and Barolo Shearwater distinct species, depending on whether <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography" title="Biogeography">biogeography</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphological</a> differences or the genetic similarity are considered more significant, and what other lineages are considered distinct from <i>P. lherminieri</i> in a particular treatment. The southern Caribbean birds were separated as <i>P. l. loyemilleri</i>, but are not distinct.<sup id="cite_ref-austinetal2004_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-austinetal2004-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
These form another distinct clade as indicated by mtDNA sequences, and have for some time been proposed as a distinct species, <b>Persian Shearwater</b> (<i>P. persicus</i>). From the molecular data alone, this seems fairly warranted, but the ranges of the two taxa are quite far apart, separated by forms of the third clade. It is quite obvious that on the basis of such contradicting data as presently available, no decision can be taken regarding the taxonomic status of these birds. Possibly, they do form a distinct species separated from the third clade by a different <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/circannual" class="extiw" title="wikt:circannual">circannual</a> rhythm, as is known from other procellariiform birds. They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypical" title="Phenotypical" class="mw-redirect">phenotypically</a> distinct, with a longer bill, a dark rump, and more extensive dark on the underwing, including some mottling in the normally white area.
If <i>P. bailloni</i> is accepted as a distinct species but <i>P. persicus</i> is not, then this latter group would have to be included in <i>P. bailloni</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-austinetal2004_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-austinetal2004-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
This group is the most confusing of all. The subspecies <i>dichrous</i> occurs in two areas which appear to be separated by the whole of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and the seas surrounding it; the Pacific subpopulation includes the proposed subspecies <i>polynesiae</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%E2%80%98%C5%AB" title="Ta‘ū" class="mw-redirect">Ta‘ū</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Samoa" title="American Samoa">American Samoa</a>) and possibly <i>gunax</i> (see below), whereas the geographically separated Indian Ocean subpopulation contains the birds formerly separated as <i>nicolae</i> (NW Indian Ocean, from Aldabra to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives" title="Maldives">Maldives</a>) and <i>colstoni</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldabra" title="Aldabra">Aldabra</a>, Arabian Sea).
There appear to be no significant genetical or morphological differences between these birds, which is quite amazing given that the Pacific and Indian Ocean subpopulations must have been isolated for a fairly long time, and that no less than three unequivocally distinct subspecies (<i>bailloni</i>, <i>persicus</i> and <i>temptator</i>) occur within the range of Indian Ocean <i>dichrous</i>. On the other hand, the supposed species <b>Mascarene Shearwater</b> ("<i>P. atrodorsalis</i>") is inseparable morphologically and genetically from <i>bailloni</i>.
Clearly, some mechanism blocking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_flow" title="Gene flow">gene flow</a> is at work, but what this is exactly remains unknown – though as remarked above, separate breeding seasons seem a reasonable assumption and are tentatively supported by the available field data.<sup id="cite_ref-carboneras1992_1-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-carboneras1992-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> In addition, it is entirely mysterious why such a mechanism should apply in the rather limited and ecologically homogenous northwestern Indian Ocean range, but not in the ecologically more diverse and by far larger Pacific range of <i>dichrous</i>.
These unresolved problems nonwithstanding, this clade – possibly including the preceding one – has been proposed to constitute a separate species, the <b>Tropical Shearwater</b> or <b>Baillon's Shearwater</b>, <i>Puffinus bailloni</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-austinetal2004_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-austinetal2004-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
These taxa could not be included in the most recent studies due to lack of material. The case of <i>gunax</i> seems fairly straightforward – as certainly as this can possibly be said in the absence of new data, it belongs to the <i>bailloni</i> clade either as a distinct subspecies, or, more likely, as yet another synonym of <i>dichrous</i>.
The case of the more distinct <i>bannermani</i>, the range of which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapatric" title="Parapatric" class="mw-redirect">parapatric</a> to that of the Pacific <i>dichrous</i>, is more complicated. It has for some time<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> been proposed as a distinct species, <b>Bannerman's Shearwater</b> (<i>P. bannermani</i>). In the absence of more recent data to investigate this claim, its status continues to be altogether unresolved, though the case for it being at least a distinct subspecies in the <i>bailloni</i> clade seems good.
