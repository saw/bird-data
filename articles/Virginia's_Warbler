Despite what its name may suggest, Virginia's warbler is not actually named after the American State of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>, which makes sense as the birds range only reaches as far east as the state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>. The bird's common eastern range is central and southern mountains of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>, central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, and central and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>. The bird was named for Virginia Anderson, the wife of an army surgeon who discovered the bird at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Burgwin" title="Fort Burgwin" class="mw-redirect">Fort Burgwin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>, in 1858. When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Fullerton_Baird" title="Spencer Fullerton Baird">Spencer Fullerton Baird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution" title="Smithsonian Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> fully described the bird for science in 1860 he honored the wishes of the warbler's discoverer and designated Virginia to be both the bird's common and scientific name.
Virginia's warbler is a small bird, only 4 to 4½&nbsp;inches in length. It is mainly gray in color, with a lighter colored under-belly and a white eye ring. The rump and undertail <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_(feather)" title="Covert (feather)" class="mw-redirect">coverts</a> are yellow. Males also have a yellow patch on their breast and a red cap, both of which are lacking in female and immature birds. Virginia's warbler can be easily mistaken for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colima_Warbler" title="Colima Warbler">Colima Warbler</a>, but it is smaller and has a more yellow rump.
Virginia's warbler is common in dense oak and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyon_pine" title="Pinyon pine">pinyon</a> woodlands and brushy streamside hills at altitudes ranging from 6,000–9,000 ft (1,800–2,700 m). It summers in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">south-western United States</a> and will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize" title="Belize">Belize</a> during the winter, as well as stopping in several Caribbean islands such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamas" title="Bahamas" class="mw-redirect">Bahamas</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turks_and_Caicos_Islands" title="Turks and Caicos Islands">Turks and Caicos Islands</a>.
Nests are built on the ground, hidden amongst dead leaves and tufts of grass at the base of a shrub or young tree. The nest is cup-shaped and constructed from moss, grass, strips of bark, and roots. The female will lay between three to five eggs, which are white in color and dotted with fine brown speckles. Young are attended to by both sexes, but incubation period and other nesting habits are mostly unknown.
