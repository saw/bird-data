The <b>Groove-billed Ani</b> (<i>Crotophaga sulcirostris</i>) is an odd-looking tropical bird in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo" title="Cuckoo">cuckoo</a> family with a long tail and a large, curved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">beak</a>. It is a resident species throughout most of its range, from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas" title="The Bahamas">The Bahamas</a>, through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, and coastal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a>. It only retreats from the northern limits of its range in Texas and northern Mexico during winter.
The Groove-billed Ani is about 34 centimetres (13&nbsp;in) long, and weighs 70–90 grams (2.5–3.2 oz). It is completely black, with a very long tail almost as long as its body. It has a huge bill with horizontal grooves along the length of the upper mandible. It is very similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth-billed_Ani" title="Smooth-billed Ani">Smooth-billed Ani</a>, some of which have bills as small as the Groove-billed and with grooves on the basal half. The two species are best distinguished by voice and range. In flight, the ani alternates between quick, choppy flaps and short glides.
Like other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ani_(bird)" title="Ani (bird)">anis</a>, the Groove-billed is found in open and partly open country, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasture" title="Pasture">pastures</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savanna</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard" title="Orchard">orchards</a>. It feeds largely on a mixed diet of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a>.
The Groove-billed Ani lives in small groups of one to five breeding pairs. They defend a single territory and lay their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a> in one communal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a>. All group members incubate the eggs and care for the young.
