The taxonomy of the group of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towhee" title="Towhee">towhees</a> to which this species belongs is debated.

Its skulking habits and nondescript appearance mean that it is not one of the better known birds. It is 19 to 25 cm (7.5 to 9.8 in) long and plump, and has a noticeably long tail, at 8.2 to 11 cm (3.2 to 4.3 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Byers_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Byers-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> This species weighs from 36.5 to 67 g (1.29 to 2.4 oz), though on average weigh only around 45&nbsp;g (1.6&nbsp;oz).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 8.2 to 10.1 cm (3.2 to 4.0 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 1.4 to 1.7 cm (0.55 to 0.67 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 2.3 to 2.7 cm (0.91 to 1.1 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Byers_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Byers-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> It is earthy brown in colour, with somewhat lighter underparts and a somewhat darker head with a rufous cap (except that birds in central Mexico have the cap the same color as the back); there is also a slightly reddish area beneath the tail.

The towhee feeds on the ground or in low scrub rather than in the tree canopy. Near human habitation, it is often seen in parking lots, where it feeds on insects on the cars' grilles and takes cover under the cars when disturbed.
