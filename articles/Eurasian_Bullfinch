The <b>Bullfinch</b>, <b>Common Bullfinch</b> or <b>Eurasian Bullfinch</b> (<i>Pyrrhula pyrrhula</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finch" title="Finch">finch</a> family Fringillidae. In Anglophone Europe it is known simply as <b>Bullfinch</b>, as it is the original bird to bear the name bullfinch.
The Bullfinch is a bulky bull-headed bird. The upper parts are grey; the flight feathers and short thick bill are black; as are the cap and face in adults (they are greyish-brown in juveniles), and the white rump and wing bars are striking in flight. The adult male has red underparts, but females and young birds have grey-buff underparts. The pleasant song of this unobtrusive bird contains fluted whistles.
The taxonomy was described in 2001 by Arnaiz-Villena et al. The closest relative of the bullfinches is genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinicola" title="Pinicola">Pinicola</a></i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_grosbeak" title="Pine grosbeak" class="mw-redirect">Pine grosbeak</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Crimson-browed_finch&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Crimson-browed finch (page does not exist)">Crimson-browed finch</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
This bird breeds across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and temperate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. It is mainly resident, but many northern birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> further south in the winter. Mixed woodland with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">conifers</a> is favoured for breeding, including parkland and gardens.
This species does not form large flocks outside the breeding season, and is usually seen as a pair or family group.
It builds its nest in a bush, (preferably more than 4 metres tall and wide),mature stands of scrub, or tree, laying four to seven eggs. It is peculiar among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passeriformes" title="Passeriformes" class="mw-redirect">Passeriformes</a> for having <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatozoa" title="Spermatozoa" class="mw-redirect">spermatozoa</a> with a rounded head and a blunt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrosome" title="Acrosome">acrosome</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The food is mainly seeds and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud" title="Bud">buds</a> of fruit trees, which can make it a pest in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard" title="Orchard">orchards</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_(tree)" title="Ash (tree)" class="mw-redirect">Ash</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crataegus_monogyna" title="Crataegus monogyna">hawthorn</a> are favoured in autumn and early winter.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> If wild bird cover is planted for it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kale" title="Kale">Kale</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoa" title="Quinoa">Quinoa</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet" title="Millet">Millet</a> are preferred, next to tall hedges or woodland.
