The <b>Antillean Nighthawk</b> (<i>Chordeiles gundlachii</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightjar" title="Nightjar">nightjar</a>.
The adults are dark with brown, grey and white patterning on the upperparts and breast; the long wings are black and show a white bar in flight. The tail is dark with white barring; the underparts are white with black bars. The adult male has a white throat; the female has a light brown throat. The most distinguishing characteristic to determine its identity from its closest relative the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Nighthawk" title="Common Nighthawk">Common Nighthawk</a> are the contrasting pale <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertials" title="Tertials" class="mw-redirect">tertials</a> near the back of the wings of a sitting bird. There are 2 color morphs, a gray and a rufous type.
Their breeding habitat is open country of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Antilles" title="Greater Antilles">Greater Antilles</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamas" title="Bahamas" class="mw-redirect">Bahamas</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Keys" title="Florida Keys">Florida Keys</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> . They usually nest on bare ground, sometimes in raised locations including stumps or gravel roofs. They especially favor recently cleared areas in forests, airport fields, cane fields and pastures,. The two eggs are laid directly on bare groundâ€”there is no nest. Incubation is performed largely by the female and lasts for about 20 days. Young fledge at about 20 days of age.
The Antillean Nighthawk migrates out of its breeding range after raising its young. It still remains unknown where the birds spend the winter.
They catch flying insects on the wing, mainly foraging near dawn and dusk (<i>crepuscular</i>) or sometimes at night with a full moon.
The call is a short <i>pikadik</i> usually heard overhead. The Common Nighthawk occasionally will make a similar call, but it is not as consistent.
