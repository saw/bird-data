The <b>Steller's Jay</b> (<i>Cyanocitta stelleri</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay" title="Jay">jay</a> native to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, closely related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Jay" title="Blue Jay">Blue Jay</a> found in the rest of the continent, but with a black head and upper body. It is also known as the <b>Long-crested Jay</b>, <b>Mountain Jay</b>, and <b>Pine Jay</b>. It is the only crested jay west of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>.
The Steller's Jay shows a great deal of regional variation throughout its range. Blackish-brown-headed birds from the north gradually become bluer-headed farther south. The Steller's Jay has a more slender bill and longer legs than the Blue Jay and has a much more pronounced crest. The head is blackish-brown with light blue streaks on the forehead. This dark coloring gives way from the shoulders and lower breast to silvery blue. The primaries and tail are a rich blue with darker barring.
It occurs in coniferous forest over much of the western half of North America from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> in the north to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> completely replacing the Blue Jay in most of those areas. Some hybridization with the Blue Jay in Colorado has been reported. The Steller's Jay lives in coniferous and mixed woodland, but not in completely dense forest, and requires open space. It typically lives in flocks of greater than 10 individuals. In autumn, flocks often visit oak woods when acorns are ripe.
The Steller's Jay primarily lives in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinophyta" title="Pinophyta">coniferous</a> forests but can be found in many forested areas. They can be found in low to moderate elevations as high as the tree line, but rarely go that high. Steller's Jays are common in residential and agricultural areas with nearby forests.
Steller's Jays are omnivores; their diet is about two-thirds plant matter and one third animal matter. Food is gathered from both the ground and from trees. The Steller's Jay's diet consists of a wide range of seeds, nuts, berries and other fruit. Many types of invertebrates, eggs, small rodents, and nestlings are also eaten. There are some accounts of them eating small reptiles, both snakes and lizards. Acorns and conifer seeds are staples during the non-breeding season; these are often cached in the ground or in trees for later consumption. They exploit human-provided food sources, frequently scavenging picnics and camp sites.
Seed that is generally consumed by Stellar's Jay, and that may also be used to bird watch from your home includes; black-oil sunflower seeds, white striped sunflower seeds, shelled peanuts and-their favorite-whole peanuts (raw). Suet is also consumed but mostly in the winter season.
The nest is usually in a conifer but is sometimes built in a hollow in a tree. Similar in construction to the Blue Jay's nest, it tends to be a bit larger (25&nbsp;cm to 43&nbsp;cm), using a number of natural materials or scavenged trash, often mixed with mud. Between two and six eggs are laid during breeding season. The eggs are oval in shape with a somewhat glossy surface. The background colour of the egg shell tends to be pale variations of greenish-blue with brown- or olive-coloured speckles. The clutch is usually incubated entirely by the female for 17 to 18 days.
Like other Jays, the Steller's Jay has numerous and variable vocalizations. One common call is a harsh "SHACK-Sheck-sheck-sheck-sheck-sheck" series; another "skreeka! skreeka!" call sounds almost exactly like an old-fashioned pump handle; yet another is a soft, breathy "hoodle hoodle" whistle. Its alarm call is a harsh, nasal "wah." The Steller's Jay also imitates the cry of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Hawk" title="Red-tailed Hawk">Red-tailed Hawk</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-shouldered_Hawk" title="Red-shouldered Hawk">Red-shouldered Hawk</a>, causing other birds to vacate feeding areas. Some calls are sex-specific: females produce a rattling sound, while males make a high-pitched "gleep gleep."
This bird is named after the German naturalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Steller" title="Georg Wilhelm Steller">Georg Wilhelm Steller</a>, the first to record them in 1741 (Evans 1986).
