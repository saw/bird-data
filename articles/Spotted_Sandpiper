The <b>Spotted Sandpiper</b> (<i>Actitis macularius</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym_(taxonomy)" title="Synonym (taxonomy)">syn.</a> <i>Actitis macularia</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorebird" title="Shorebird" class="mw-redirect">shorebird</a>, 18â€“20&nbsp;cm long. Together with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_species" title="Sister species" class="mw-redirect">sister species</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Sandpiper" title="Common Sandpiper">Common Sandpiper</a> (<i>A. hypoleucos</i>) they make up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i>Actitis</i>. They replace each other geographically; stray birds may <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridisation_in_shorebirds#Other_hybrid_scolopacids" title="Hybridisation in shorebirds">settle down</a> with breeders of the other species and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybridize</a>.
Their breeding habitat is near fresh water across most of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. They <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to the southern United States and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, and are very rare vagrants to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. These are not gregarious birds and are seldom seen in flocks.
Adults have short yellowish legs and an orange bill with a dark tip. The body is brown on top and white underneath with black spots. Non-breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a>, depicted below, do not have the spotted underparts, and are very similar to the Common Sandpiper of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>; the main difference is the more washed-out wing pattern visible in flight and the normally light yellow legs and feet of the Spotted Sandpiper. The <i>Actitis</i> species have a distinctive stiff-winged flight low over the water.
Spotted Sandpipers nest on the ground. During each summer breeding season, females may mate with and lay clutches for more than one male, leaving incubation to them. This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyandry" title="Polyandry">polyandry</a>. Male parents of first clutches may father chicks in later male's clutchs, probably due to sperm storage within female reproductive tracts, which is common in birds. Females that fail to find additional mates usually help incubate and rear chicks. "Prior to incubation, blood plasma concentrations of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are substantially higher in males than in females" and these levels plummet 25-fold in males as incubation proceeds.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Additionally, mated females have testosterone concentrations that are 7 times higher than those of unmated females.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
These birds forage on ground or water, picking up food by sight. They may also catch insects in flight. They eat insects, crustaceans and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a>. As they forage, they can be recognized by their constant nodding and teetering.
