The <b>Violet Sabrewing</b> (<i>Campylopterus hemileucurus</i>) is a very large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird" title="Hummingbird">hummingbird</a> native to southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a> and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a>.
It is a species of the understory and edges of mountain forests, especially near streams. The female Violet Sabrewing lays its two white eggs in a relatively large cup nest on a low horizontal branch, usually over a stream.
The Violet Sabrewing is 15&nbsp;cm long; the male weighs 11.5&nbsp;g and the female 9.5&nbsp;g. It is the largest hummingbird found outside of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> and the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrewing" title="Sabrewing">sabrewing</a>. The adult male is deep violet, with a dark green back and wing coverts. The shafts of the maleâ€™s outer primary flight feathers are thickened and flattened to give the distinctive feature which gives the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrewing" title="Sabrewing">sabrewings</a> their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> and scientific names. The three outer pairs of feathers of the otherwise black tail are white; this gives rise to the scientific species name, <i>hemileucurus</i> translating as "half-white tail", but several other sabrewings share the tail pattern, not least the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-tailed_Sabrewing" title="White-tailed Sabrewing">White-tailed Sabrewing</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobago" title="Tobago">Tobago</a>.
The female is dark green above and grey below apart from a violet throat; the tail pattern is the same as the male's. Young Violet Sabrewings have buff edges to the feathers and lack any violet, although juvenile males may be dusky green-blue below.
The food of this species is nectar, taken mainly from undergrowth flowers with <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliconia" title="Heliconia">Heliconias</a></i> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana" title="Banana">bananas</a> as favourites. The males are less aggressive and territorial at flowers than their size would suggest.
The call of the Violet Sabrewing is a sharp twitter, and the song of the male, given at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lek_(animal_behavior)" title="Lek (animal behavior)" class="mw-redirect">leks</a> of up to ten males, is a high-pitched piercing <i>cheep tsew cheep tik-tik tsew</i>.
