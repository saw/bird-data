The <b>Crissal Thrasher</b> (<i>Toxostoma crissale</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrasher" title="Thrasher">thrasher</a> found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">Southwestern United States</a> (western Texas, southern New Mexico, southern Arizona, southeastern California, extreme southern Nevada, and extreme southwestern Utah) to central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.
The bird grows to 32&nbsp;cm (12.5&nbsp;inches), and has a deeply curved bill. The eyes are dull yellow. Bird expert <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Tory_Peterson" title="Roger Tory Peterson">Roger Tory Peterson</a> described its singing as sweeter and less spasmodic than other thrashers.<sup id="cite_ref-Peterson_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Peterson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It can be found near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert" title="Desert">desert</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streams" title="Streams" class="mw-redirect">streams</a> in dense underbrush, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesquite" title="Mesquite">mesquite</a> thickets, willows, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Scrub_Oak" title="California Scrub Oak" class="mw-redirect">scrub oak</a>, high elevations in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzanita" title="Manzanita">manzanita</a>, and in the low desert near canyon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaparral" title="Chaparral">chaparral</a>.

In the early years of the study of the birds of western North America, this species was confused with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Thrasher" title="California Thrasher">California Thrasher</a> (<i>Toxostoma redivivum</i>), to which it is closely related. Descriptions of <i>T. redivivum</i> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassin" title="John Cassin">John Cassin</a>'s 1856 book <i>Illustrations of the Birds of California, Texas, Oregon, British, and Russian America</i><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> led later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithologist" title="Ornithologist" class="mw-redirect">ornithologists</a> to conclude that at least three of the birds described were actually the Crissal Thrasher. When an army surgeon working in New Mexico sent Cassin specimens of a bird that he believed to be the California Thrasher, Cassin sent the specimens to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Baird" title="Spencer Baird" class="mw-redirect">Spencer Baird</a> at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution" title="Smithsonian Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>. Baird determined that it was not a California Thrasher and published his findings in 1858, identifying the Crissal Thrasher as a new species.<sup id="cite_ref-CornellBirds_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CornellBirds-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
Printer's errors in Baird's 1858 publication led to longstanding confusion and contention over the naming of the Crissal Thrasher. As printed, Baird's publication identified the new species as <i>Toxostoma dorsalis</i>, because the printer had switched the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> name of the new thrasher with the species name of a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junco" title="Junco">junco</a> species, <i>Junco dorsalis</i>. Baird arranged for the error to be corrected, recording the name as <i>T. crissalis</i> the following month. Thereafter, the <i>T. crissalis</i> name was accepted and used until 1920, when ornithologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Oberholser" title="Harry Oberholser" class="mw-redirect">Harry Oberholser</a> published a note asserting that <i>T. dorsalis</i> must be used instead because it had publication priority over <i>T. crissalis</i>, even though the original publication had been a mistake and had been quickly corrected.<sup id="cite_ref-CornellBirds_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CornellBirds-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Auk_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Auk-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> As a result, the <i>T. dorsalis</i> epithet appeared in ornithological literature until 1983, when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Zoological_Nomenclature" title="International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature">International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature</a> formally restored Baird's intended name of <i>T. crissale</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-CornellBirds_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CornellBirds-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Crissal Thrasher builds its nests in dense shrubs about 3 to 8 feet up, typically under a large branch for protection both from other birds and the sun.<sup id="cite_ref-orn_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-orn-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Utah_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Utah-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The male and female cooperate in building the cup-shaped nest, which is built from twigs and lined with finer vegetation.<sup id="cite_ref-orn_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-orn-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Utah_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Utah-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The eggs, which are blue in color and lack spots (this is the only species of thrasher to lay eggs without spots),<sup id="cite_ref-orn_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-orn-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> are laid in clutches of 2 to 3 eggs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubated</a> for about 2 weeks, with both the male and female taking turns on the nest. The young are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledged</a> 11 to 13 days after they hatch.<sup id="cite_ref-Utah_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Utah-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The chick is paler and duller than the adult, with a browner undertail.<sup id="cite_ref-CornellguideID_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CornellguideID-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
The species is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore" title="Omnivore">omnivore</a>, eating both insects and spiders, and seeds and fruits. The Crissal Thrasher is mainly a ground feeder, using its long bill to probe for its prey amongst the leaf litter, particularly under shrubs.<sup id="cite_ref-orn_4-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-orn-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CornellBirds_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CornellBirds-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Utah_8-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Utah-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
