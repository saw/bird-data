<i>Gavia imber</i>
The <b>Great Northern Loon</b> (<i>Gavia immer</i>), is a large member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loon" title="Loon">loon</a>, or diver, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family" title="Family">family</a> of birds. The species is known as the <b>Common Loon</b> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and the <b>Great Northern Diver</b> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>; its current name is a compromise proposed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ornithological_Committee" title="International Ornithological Committee">International Ornithological Committee</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Great Northern Loon is one of the five <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loon" title="Loon">loon</a> species that make up the genus <i>Gavia</i>, the only genus of the family Gavidae and order Gaviiformes. Its closest relative is the other large black-headed species, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-billed_Loon" title="Yellow-billed Loon">Yellow-billed Loon</a> or White-billed Diver, <i>Gavia adamsii</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Boertmann_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Boertmann-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The genus name <i>Gavia</i> was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> term for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smew" title="Smew">Smew</a> (<i>Mergellus albellus</i>). This small sea-duck is quite unrelated to loons and just happens to be another black-and-white seabird which swims and dives for fish. It is not likely that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Romans" title="Ancient Romans" class="mw-redirect">Ancient Romans</a> had much knowledge of loons, as these are limited to more northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude" title="Latitude">latitudes</a> and since the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period" title="Last glacial period">last glacial period</a> seem to have occurred only as rare winter migrants in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean" title="Mediterranean" class="mw-redirect">Mediterranean</a> region.<sup id="cite_ref-brodkorb_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-brodkorb-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-arnott_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-arnott-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The specific name <i>immer</i> is derived from North Germanic names for the bird such as modern Icelandic "Himbrimi".<sup id="cite_ref-Dlgroup_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dlgroup-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The term is related to Swedish <i>immer</i> and <i>emmer</i>, the grey or blackened ashes of a fire, referring to its dark plumage; or to Latin <i>immergo</i>, to immerse, and <i>immersus</i>, submerged.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The European name "diver" comes from the bird's habit of catching fish by swimming calmly along the surface and then abruptly plunging into the water. The North American name "loon" is a reference to the bird's clumsiness on land, and is derived from Scandinavian words for lame, such as Icelandic "lúinn" and Swedish "lam".<sup id="cite_ref-Dlgroup_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dlgroup-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
Adults can range from 61 to 100&nbsp;cm (24–40&nbsp;inches) in length with a 122–152&nbsp;cm (4–5-foot) wingspan, slightly smaller than the similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-billed_Loon" title="Yellow-billed Loon">Yellow-billed Loon</a> (or "White-billed Diver"). The weight can vary from 1.6 to 8&nbsp;kg (3.6 to 17.6&nbsp;lbs). On average a Great Northern Loon is about 81&nbsp;cm (32&nbsp;inches) long, has a wingspan of 136&nbsp;cm (54&nbsp;inches), and weighs about 4.1&nbsp;kg (9&nbsp;lbs).
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction" title="Reproduction">Breeding</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adults" title="Adults" class="mw-redirect">adults</a> have a black head, white underparts, and a checkered black-and-white mantle. Non-breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">plumage</a> is brownish, with the chin and foreneck white. The bill is black-blue and held horizontally. The bill colour and angle distinguish this species from the similar Yellow-billed Loon.
The Great Northern Loon breeds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>.

This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a>, like all divers, is a specialist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>-eater, catching its prey underwater, diving as deep as 200 feet (60&nbsp;m).

The bird needs a long distance to gain momentum for take-off, and is ungainly on landing. Its clumsiness on land is due to the legs being positioned at the rear of the body: this is ideal for diving but not well-suited for walking. When the birds land on water, they skim along on their bellies to slow down, rather than on their feet, as these are set too far back. The loon swims gracefully on the surface, dives as well as any flying bird, and flies competently for hundreds of kilometers in migration. It flies with its neck outstretched, usually calling a particular tremolo that can be used to identify a flying loon. Its call has been alternately called "haunting," "beautiful," "thrilling," "mystical" and "enchanting."<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Great Northern Loon nests are usually placed on islands, where ground-based predators cannot normally access them. However, eggs and nestlings have been taken by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gulls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvid" title="Corvid" class="mw-redirect">corvids</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon" title="Raccoon">raccoons</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk" title="Skunk">skunks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mink" title="Mink">minks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox" title="Fox">foxes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapping_turtle" title="Snapping turtle" class="mw-redirect">snapping turtles</a> and large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>. Adults are not regularly preyed upon, but have been taken by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_otter" title="Sea otter">sea otters</a> (when wintering) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_Eagle" title="Bald Eagle">Bald Eagles</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osprey" title="Osprey">Ospreys</a> have been observed harassing divers, more likely out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptoparasitism" title="Kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitism</a> than predation.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> When approached by a predator of either its nest or itself, divers sometimes attack the predator by rushing at it and attempting to impale it through the abdomen or the back of the head or neck.
The female lays 1 to 3 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> on a hollowed-out mound of dirt and vegetation very close to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a>. Both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parents" title="Parents" class="mw-redirect">parents</a> build the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a>, sit on the egg or eggs, and feed the young.
These birds have disappeared from some lakes in eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> due to the effects of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a>, as well as lead poisoning from fishing sinkers and mercury contamination from industrial waste. Artificial floating nesting platforms have been provided for loons in some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakes" title="Lakes" class="mw-redirect">lakes</a> to reduce the impact of changing water levels due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam" title="Dam">dams</a> and other human activities.
The Great Northern Loon is one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEWA" title="AEWA" class="mw-redirect">AEWA</a>) applies.

The voice and appearance of the Great Northern Loon has made it prominent in several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Native American</a> tales. These include a story of a loon which created the world in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chippewa" title="Chippewa" class="mw-redirect">Chippewa</a> story; a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micmac" title="Micmac" class="mw-redirect">Micmac</a> saga describes Kwee-moo, the loon who was a special messenger of Glooscap (Glu-skap), the tribal hero; native tribes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> believed that an excess of calls from this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> predicted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain" title="Rain">rain</a>, and even brought it; and the tale of the loon's necklace was handed down in many versions among Pacific Coast peoples. Folk names include big loon, black-billed loon, call-up-a-storm, ember-goose, greenhead, guinea duck, imber diver, ring-necked loon, and walloon.
This bird is central to the plot of the novel <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern%3F" title="Great Northern?">Great Northern?</a></i> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Ransome" title="Arthur Ransome">Arthur Ransome</a> (in which it is referred to throughout as Great Northern Diver, with the obsolete scientific name <i>Colymbus immer</i>). The story is set in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Hebrides" title="Outer Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a>, where the main characters—a group of children on holiday—notice a pair of loons apparently nesting there. Checking their bird book, they believe this to be the Great Northern Loon; however, this has not previously been seen to nest in northern Scotland, and so they ask for help from an ornithologist. He confirms that these birds are indeed the Great Northern; unfortunately, it soon transpires that he does not wish merely to observe, but wants to steal the eggs and add them to his collection; and to do this, he must first kill the birds. Published in 1947, the story is one where the conservationists are the eventual victors over the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_collecting" title="Egg collecting" class="mw-redirect">egg collector</a>, at a time when the latter hobby was not widely considered to be harmful.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
