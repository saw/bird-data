<i>Erolia fuscicollis</i>
The <b>White-rumped Sandpiper</b> (<i>Calidris fuscicollis</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorebird" title="Shorebird" class="mw-redirect">shorebird</a>.
Adults have black legs and a small thin dark bill. The body is dark brown on top and mainly white underneath, with brown streaks on the breast and a white rump. They have a white stripe over their eyes. This bird shows long wings in flight. In winter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a>, this species is pale gray above. This bird can be difficult to distinguish from other similar tiny shorebirds; these are known collectively as "peeps" or "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stint" title="Stint">stints</a>".
One of the best identification features is the long wings, which extend beyond the tail when the bird is on the ground. Only the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baird%27s_Sandpiper" title="Baird's Sandpiper">Baird's Sandpiper</a> also shows this, and that bird can be distinguished by the lack of a white rump.
Their breeding habitat is the northern tundra on Arctic islands in Canada and Alaska. They nest on the ground, usually well-concealed in vegetation.
They are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">long distance migrant</a>, wintering in northern South America. They are rare but regular vagrants to western Europe. The species is a rare vagrant to Australia.
These birds forage by probing on mudflats or tundra or picking up food by sight in shallow water. They mainly eat insects, mollusks and marine worms, also some plant material.
