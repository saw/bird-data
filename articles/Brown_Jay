<i>Cyanocorax morio</i>
The <b>Brown Jay</b> (<i>Psilorhinus morio</i>) is a large American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay" title="Jay">Jay</a> which has the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">habitus</a> of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magpie" title="Magpie">magpie</a>, but is slightly smaller and with a shorter tail, though the bill is larger.
It occurs from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> south into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> on the Gulf slope. The northernmost extent of the bird is on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande" title="Rio Grande">Rio Grande</a> in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, the lower region of the river called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_Valley" title="Rio Grande Valley">Rio Grande Valley</a>, (of Texas).
Brown Jays vary in plumage geographically: there are two main groups. Northern birds are almost completely dark brown, with lighter brown on the underparts. Southern birds are white-bellied and have bright white tips to the outer tailfeathers. The intergrade zone is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz" title="Veracruz">Veracruz</a>.
Adults in both populations have black bills, legs, and feet. Immatures have yellow bare parts, including yellow eye-rings.
The voice is a loud but low pitched <i>pee-ah</i> call and is often modified to suit its situation or mood.
Food is sought largely in trees but it also takes some food from the ground. Insects and a wide range of other invertebrates are taken, also lizards, fruit,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> and nectar. Though it does take eggs and nestlings, it appears not to if there is plenty of other foods available.
The nest is built in a tree or large shrub with both sexes helping in construction. There are normally three eggs laid but six is not unusual. Incubation is between 18 and 20 days. Only the female broods but the father feeds her while doing so.
Sometimes the young from another year will help in raising the chicks too. If a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helpers_at_the_nest" title="Helpers at the nest">helper bird</a> returns with food, it will give it to one of the resident parents to feed the chicks.
In Central America the Brown Jay is not found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a>; the range also appears on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a> side of Central America in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>, and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a>.
