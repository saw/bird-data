The first reference to a coot in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands" title="Hawaiian Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a> was by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bloxam" title="Andrew Bloxam">Andrew Bloxam</a>, who saw it, although he did not collect a specimen, while in the islands in 1825 as the naturalist on board <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Blonde_(1819)" title="HMS Blonde (1819)">HMS <i>Blonde</i></a>. He mistook it for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Coot" title="Eurasian Coot">Eurasian Coot</a>, <i>Fulica atra</i>. It is now considered either to be a separate species, <i>Fulica alai</i>, or a subspecies of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Coot" title="American Coot">American Coot</a>, <i>Fulica americana alai</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
On Oahu, Maui, Molokai and Kaua’i, the Hawaiian coot was previously abundant in coastal brackish and fresh-water ponds, streams, and marshes;<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> however, the first censuses conducted in the 1950s and 1960s detected fewer than 1,000 birds statewide.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Since the 1960s, the interannual population size has fluctuated from less than 1,000 birds to over 3,000, and appears to be gradually increasing. Biannual surveys conducted by the Hawaiian Department of Land and Natural Resource’s Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW) found that between 1998 and 2003 the inter-island coot population averaged 2,100 birds, ranging between 1,500 and 3,000 birds.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Recent surveys estimated winter populations fluctuating around 1,500 birds and a summer population fluctuating around 2,000 birds.<sup id="cite_ref-Wildlife_Service_2010_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wildlife_Service_2010-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
