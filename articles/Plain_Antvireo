The <b>Plain Antvireo</b> (<i>Dysithamnus mentalis</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antbird" title="Antbird">antbird</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> (Thamnophilidae), wherein it belongs to the antshrike <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfamily" title="Subfamily" class="mw-redirect">subfamily</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=Thamnophilinae&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Thamnophilinae (page does not exist)">Thamnophilinae</a>). It is a resident breeder in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical" title="Tropical" class="mw-redirect">tropical</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>.
The Plain Antvireo is typically 11.4&nbsp;cm long, and weighs 13.5 g. The adult male has a slate grey head and upperparts, blackish cheeks, three narrow white wing bars, pale grey underparts and a white belly. The female has olive brown upperparts, a rufous crown, a white eye-ring, yellowish-buff underparts and weakly buff-barred rufous wings. A white (male) or buff (female) shoulder stripe is only visible when the wing is spread. Immature males are much like the adult male, but have brown edgings to the flight feathers, an olive rump and yellowish underparts.
Depending on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>, there are large variations in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> of both sexes, especially in the colour of the underparts (yellow to white), the darkness of the face, the amount of olive to the upperparts of the male, and the amount of rufous to the upperparts of the female.
It has a musical <i>buu-bu-bu-bu-u-u-u</i> song, and calls include a weak <i>naaa</i> and a questioning <i>bu-u-u-u-u?</i>
This is a common and confiding bird of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_forest" title="Primary forest" class="mw-redirect">primary</a> and secondary forest. The Plain Antvireo breeds from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> south to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, and on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobago" title="Tobago">Tobago</a>. It is patchily distributed at the margins of its range and generally (but not universally) avoids the lowlands.
In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana" title="Guyana">Guyana</a> for example, it is at least locally common above 1,000 meters <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level" title="Above mean sea level">ASL</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakaraima_Mountains" title="Pakaraima Mountains" class="mw-redirect">Pakaraima Mountains</a> (though not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Roraima" title="Mount Roraima">Mount Roraima</a>), and also inhabits the southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acari_Mountains" title="Acari Mountains" class="mw-redirect">Acari Mountains</a>. On the other hand, it has not been recorded from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwokrama_Forest" title="Iwokrama Forest">Iwokrama Forest</a> or the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Potaro_Plateau&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Potaro Plateau (page does not exist)">Potaro Plateau</a>. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> where upland habitat is mainly restricted to the northwest, the species occurs only here and there in most of the country. For example, the Plain Antvireo was found to be common, a few dozen meters ASL, in the <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Dipteryx_oleifera&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dipteryx oleifera (page does not exist)">Dipteryx oleifera</a></i>-dominated primary forest of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Refugio_Bartola&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Refugio Bartola (page does not exist)">Refugio Bartola</a> in the very south of Nicaragua.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Plain Antvireo feeds like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vireo" title="Vireo">vireo</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbird</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> Vireonidae, hence its common name. It forages for small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a> taken from twigs and foliage in the lower branches of trees. It usually does not join <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-species_feeding_flock" title="Mixed-species feeding flock" class="mw-redirect">mixed-species feeding flocks</a> often, preferring to keep its distance from other species it encounters when attending <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_ant" title="Army ant">army ant</a> swarms. Locally, however (e.g. as noted in the somewhat atypical habitat of Refugio Bartola), it may attend mixed-species flocks more frequently. But usually, it is encountered in pairs or small groups, such as adults with last years' young or birds congregating at a special food source. Breeding pairs are quite territorial against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific" title="Conspecific" class="mw-redirect">conspecifics</a> however, and defend a patch of habitat that may be as large as about 7,000 square metres, but sometimes is only half that size.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The female lays two cinnamon-marked white eggs in a small deep cup nest in the lateral fork of a sapling. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 15 days to hatching, with a further 9 days to fledging. If the nest is approached, an incubating bird will drop to the ground and flutter weakly to distract the potential predator. During this, the light shoulder stripe is flashed conspicuously to attract the intruder's attention to the parent.
Due to its large range, this species is not considered threatened by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> It appears to be tolerant of some degree of habitat disturbance and/or human activity.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
