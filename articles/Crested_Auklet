The <b>Crested Auklet</b> (<i>Aethia cristatella</i>) is a small seabird of the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcidae" title="Alcidae" class="mw-redirect">Alcidae</a> which nests in huge colonies (&gt;1 million individuals) in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bering_Sea" title="Bering Sea">Bering Sea</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Okhotsk" title="Sea of Okhotsk">Sea of Okhotsk</a>. They often breed in mixed-species colonies with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Auklet" title="Least Auklet">Least Auklets</a>, their smaller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congener" title="Congener">congener</a>.
The Crested Auklet can measure 18–27 cm (7.1–11 in) in length, 34–50 cm (13–20 in) in wingspan and weigh 195–330 g (6.9–12 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It is recognized primarily by two characteristics during the breeding season. The first is its 'crest', a group of bristle feathers located on top of its head above its eyes. The second is a social odor that the auklets produce during the breeding season, which has been described as smelling like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangerine" title="Tangerine">tangerines</a>.
Crested Auklets primarily forage in deep waters, however sometimes in areas closer to the shore, but always in large flocks. Little is known about the winter diets, however, it is suggested that they feed on a variety of marine invertebrates.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Crested Auklets are <a class="external text" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/planktivore">planktivores</a>.

The Crested Auklet breeding season begins mid-May and ends mid-August.<sup id="cite_ref-Jones_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Jones-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Their nesting sites are within the rocky crevices of North Pacific coast. They breed in dense colonies, with up to one million birds in one space. Because of this, nesting sites are in close proximity, with as little as 0.3 meters between nests. Even so, there is a high degree of territoriality and adults show a high degree of site fidelity within a year.<sup id="cite_ref-Klenova_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Klenova-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Because mating occurs at sea and males have no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ" title="Sex organ">copulatory organ</a>, males must hover over females for a successful mating. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_choice" title="Mate choice">Mate choice</a> is mutual, but females do have final choice on breeding partner.<sup id="cite_ref-Zubakin_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Zubakin-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
Crested Auklets are highly social during the breeding season, before pair formation, and after pair formation. Within a breeding year, however, crested auklets are monogamous, with only 10% of population having extra-pair copulations. Partners continue to self-advertise to other birds when they are not incubating. While some of this advertising behavior can be linked to extra-pair mating, it is suggested that continuation of the behavior allows birds to find pairs for the next breeding season. Only 45.5% of birds remain with the same partner in the subsequent breeding season. <sup id="cite_ref-Zubakin_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Zubakin-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
Both sexes invest highly in parental care; parents share equally in incubating the single egg and raising the chick. Since both sexes are ornamented, crested auklets align with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Trivers" title="Robert Trivers">Robert Trivers</a>’ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_investment" title="Parental investment">parental investment theory</a>, where it is expected that with biparental care, mutual choosiness will arise. <sup id="cite_ref-Amundsen_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Amundsen-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
Crested Auklets are unique in their use of optical, vocal, and olfactory signals in mating. Their communicative behavior is more complex and diversified compared to other closely related species. There are three general evolutionary mechanisms proposed to address the origin of Crested Auklets elaborate display traits:
Crested Auklets are known for their forehead crests, which is made of black forward-curving feathers. These forehead crests are highly variable, and can have between two to twenty three narrow forward curving feathers. The average Auklet has 12 feathers. These feathers are also of variable height, between 8.1-58.5mm.<sup id="cite_ref-mutual_sexual_selection_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mutual_sexual_selection-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Additionally, Auklets have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auricular_muscles" title="Auricular muscles">auricular</a> plumes and a bright orange bill with curved accessory plates. <sup id="cite_ref-experimental_evidence_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-experimental_evidence-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Like forehead crests, there is extreme variability in the display of these traits within a population. Asserted dominance, with regards to claimed display area, has been correlated with crest length in both males and females. The existence of these showy monomorphic traits is indicative of intense sexual selection for both sexes. Large-crested adults of both sexes receive higher levels of sexual interest and displays from the opposite sex compared to those with smaller crests. <sup id="cite_ref-mutual_sexual_selection_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mutual_sexual_selection-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>Crested Anklets with larger crests are more likely to obtain mates and form pair bonds earlier.
Based on divorce rate and mortality, more than half of individuals find a new mate each year. <sup id="cite_ref-experimental_evidence_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-experimental_evidence-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Female crest length is the primary factor of male mate switching between years. <sup id="cite_ref-vocal_and_optical_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vocal_and_optical-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
While there is variation in displays across populations, Crested Auklet crests and plume ornaments are consistent in expression within an individual over time. Furthermore, there is little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> or evidence of condition dependence. From studies, it seems to be a survival neutral ornament. <sup id="cite_ref-Jones_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Jones-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Some studies, however, offer up a functional purpose for these ornaments. One study suggests a link between habitat complexity and facial feathering, where tactile facial elongation helps individuals navigate complex underground crevices.<sup id="cite_ref-Seneviratne_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Seneviratne-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Because of the high density of the crested auklets’ nesting sites, it is logical to expect selective pressures for additional sensory mechanisms.
Crested Auklets have a wide variety of single and complex calls. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billing_(birds)" title="Billing (birds)" class="mw-redirect">Billing</a> is “defined as pair courtship with mutual cackling vocal display.” It is a crucial part of successful pair formation and becomes harmonious once male and female partners are well acquainted.<sup id="cite_ref-Zubakin_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Zubakin-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Trumpet calls are one of the most common advertising calls. The call represents a complex but stereotyped vocal sequence that is linked with a specific visual display.<sup id="cite_ref-Klenova_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Klenova-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Between individuals, the calls differ in duration and frequency. Calls are primarily performed in males, but can also be seen in females. The call is particularly strong in widowed females.<sup id="cite_ref-Zubakin_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Zubakin-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> These calls stay stable from year to year, and individuals’ specific calls are associated with the maintenance of long-term social bonds between pair mates and between neighbors. This suggests that trumpet calls can be used for both short-term and long-term individual recognition. Recognition of neighboring individuals’ calls is advantageous because it minimizes energy expenditure on aggressive displays, and prevents conflict between neighbors and trusted individuals--the “dear enemy phenomenon.”<sup id="cite_ref-Klenova_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Klenova-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Crested Auklets have distinctive citrus-like plumage odor. This odor originates from tiny wick feathers, which are located in a small patch of skin between shoulder blades. The scent is released when there is ruffling of feathers on the nape and upper back of the individual from threat, trumpeting, or billing displays. The cloud of scent released encourages the ruff sniff display. A ruff sniff display is when birds fully insert their half open, bill into the others' plumage. This display occurs in the absence of obvious aggression and is important for pair formation.<sup id="cite_ref-Zubakin_6-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Zubakin-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> For both sexes, a strong odor attracts more individuals, who then do a ruff sniff display. <sup id="cite_ref-vocal_and_optical_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vocal_and_optical-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
Odor secretions increase during the breeding season, highlighting its association with courtship and mate selection. The scent may also act as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism" title="Parasitism">ectoparasite</a> repellent. <sup id="cite_ref-Rajchard_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rajchard-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>, Crested Auklets are of least concern. The global population is estimated to be 6 million individuals, while the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> population is estimated at 2.9 million birds. However, an accurate assessment of the number of birds is difficult, since those on the surface of the colony and in the nearby sea is only a small proportion of the variable and poorly understood population. Even though the global concern is limited, there is more concern for the North American population, specifically in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>. There has been high predation by rats, which have escaped fishing vessels in the harbor. Additionally, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_spill" title="Oil spill">oil spills</a> and collisions with light sources pose additional risk. In Alaska, there is also some subsistence hunting of Crested Auklets. <sup id="cite_ref-alaska_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-alaska-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
