<i>Colymbus auritus</i>
The <b>Horned Grebe</b> (<i>Podiceps auritus</i>)<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> is a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grebe" title="Grebe">grebe</a> family of water <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a>. It is also known as the <b>Slavonian Grebe</b>. It is an excellent swimmer and diver, and pursues its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> prey underwater. <i>P. auritus</i> is one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEWA" title="AEWA" class="mw-redirect">AEWA</a>) applies.
The Horned Grebe is a small grebe at 31–38 centimetres (12–15 in) long with a 46–55 centimetres (18–22 in) wingspan. Unmistakable in summer, the plumage of both male and female includes a black head with brown puffy earlike tufts along the sides of its face. It shows a deep red neck, scarlet eyes, and a small, straight black bill tipped with white. It rides high in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a>.
Horned Grebes breed in vegetated areas of freshwater <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakes" title="Lakes" class="mw-redirect">lakes</a> across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. It also breeds in remote inland parts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and much of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>. Most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds" title="Birds" class="mw-redirect">birds</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> in winter to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast" title="Coast">coast</a>. During this time, this small grebe is mainly white with a sharply defined black cap. During <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction" title="Reproduction">breeding</a>, the male's call is heard as an odd, striking series of loud croaks and chattering notes followed by prolonged shrieks.
Like all grebes, it builds a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> on the water's edge, since its legs are set very far back and it cannot walk well. Usually two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> are laid, and the striped young are sometimes carried on the adult's back.
Folk names of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> include Devil-diver, hell-diver, pink-eyed diver, and water witch. Its name is often abbreviated by British birders to "Slav Grebe" or simply "Slav".
In the lore of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfeet" title="Blackfeet" class="mw-redirect">Blackfeet</a>, the trickster <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfeet#The_Sun_and_the_Moon" title="Blackfeet" class="mw-redirect">Old Man</a> tricked several ducks into closing their eyes and dancing while he killed them one by one. However, the smallest duck looked, saw Old Man, and alerted the other ducks. This "duck" was the Horned Grebe, who became the first to notice trouble.<sup id="cite_ref-WeidensaulA_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WeidensaulA-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
