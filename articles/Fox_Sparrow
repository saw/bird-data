The <b>Fox Sparrow</b> (<i>Passerella iliaca</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_sparrow" title="American sparrow">American sparrow</a>. It is the only member of the genus <i>Passerella</i>, although some authors split the genus into four species (see below).
More specific information regarding plumage is available in the accounts for the various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxa" title="Taxa" class="mw-redirect">taxa</a>.
Adults are amongst the largest sparrows, heavily spotted and streaked underneath. All feature a messy central breast spot though it is less noticeable on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thick-billed_Fox_Sparrow" title="Thick-billed Fox Sparrow">thick billed</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate-colored_Fox_Sparrow" title="Slate-colored Fox Sparrow">slate-colored</a> varieties. Plumage varies markedly from one group to another.
These birds forage by scratching the ground, which makes them vulnerable to cats and other predators, though they are generally plentiful. Fox sparrows birds [[bird migration|migrate] on the west coast of the United States.
They mainly eat seeds and insects, as well as some berries. Coastal fox sparrows may also eat crustaceans.
Fox sparrows nest in wooded areas across northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the west coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>. They nest either in a sheltered location on the ground or low in trees or shrubs. Nest typically contains two to five pale green to greenish white eggs speckled with reddish browns.<sup id="cite_ref-TBH_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TBH-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>

Particularly the contact zones between the Slate-colored and Thick-billed Fox Sparrows which are only weakly distinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphologically</a> were of interest; the other groups were found to be distinct far earlier (Swarth 1920).
The combined molecular data is unable to resolve the interrelationship of the subspecies group and of subspecies in these, but aids in confirming the distinctness of the Thick-billed group (Zink &amp; Weckstein 2003). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography" title="Biogeography">Biogeography</a> indicates that the coastal populations were probably isolated during an epoch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaciation" title="Glaciation" class="mw-redirect">glaciation</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> range, but this is also not very helpful in resolving the remaining problems of within-group diversity, and inter-group relationships.
