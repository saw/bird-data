Rose-throated Becards usually occur in riparian areas of pine-oak woodlands and evergreen forest. They breed from south-easternmost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> and extreme southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a>. Breeding is local and sporadic in the USA, and becomes more regular in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Birds are normally permanent residents, but any birds found in the US do retreat for the winter.
The most distinguishing characteristics of this bird is the rose-colored neck bib found in adult males. Males are mostly gray in color, with a contrasting darker upperside and a pale gray underside. Males also show a black crown. Females are mostly brown in color, with a rusty brown upperside, and a pale buffy underside. The crown is a dark gray, not nearly as stunning as the males. Its usual call is a mournful "seeeeuuuwww".
They make a large foot-long globular nest, usually suspended from a tree limb. The entrance hole is found on the bottom. The female lays three to four eggs.
