<i>Zoothera naevia</i>
The <b>Varied Thrush</b> (<i>Ixoreus naevius</i>) is a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_(bird)" title="Thrush (bird)">thrush</a> family Turdidae.
The German naturalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Gmelin" title="Johann Friedrich Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> described the Varied Thrush in 1789. Two subspecies are recognised.
The Varied Thrush is a fairly large thrush species. It can range from 20 to 26 cm (7.9 to 10 in) in length and can span 34 to 42 cm (13 to 17 in) across the wings. Body mass can vary from 65 to 100 g (2.3 to 3.5 oz). Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 11.8 to 13.6 cm (4.6 to 5.4 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 1.8 to 2.3 cm (0.71 to 0.91 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 2.9 to 3.3 cm (1.1 to 1.3 in). It is similar in size to the widespread <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Robin" title="American Robin">American Robin</a>, though the Varied is on average shorter with a heavier, more robust build.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> In general, Varied Thrushes feature intense orange and black feathers.<sup id="cite_ref-george1_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-george1-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Adult males exhibit medium orange with a curved gray pattern at the breasts and throats, with grayish-blue tail ends, scruffs, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(anatomy)" title="Crown (anatomy)">crowns</a>. They also possess a tufted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercilium" title="Supercilium">supraloral stripe</a> and streaks of dark colors on its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">flight feathers</a>. Its bill is also achromatic, but tan near the bottom of the lower jaw. Its legs are often tawny or dark brown. Females' markings are not as well-defined, with olive-browns and grays, brown hind feathers, and indiscernible gray-brown plumage near the breasts. Young Varied Thrushes are generally brown, though its stomach feathers are white, and initially harbors two orange stripes at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_feathers" title="Covert feathers" class="mw-redirect">covert feathers</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-george2_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-george2-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
There is an extremely rare variant of this species in which all the orange in the plumage is replaced by white. A very rare British <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrancy_(biology)" title="Vagrancy (biology)">vagrant</a> in 1982 was of this type, leading to speculation that whatever mutation causes the colour variation also affects the navigational abilities of this thrush. There has been only five recorded sightings since 1921.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Varied Thrush breeds in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>. It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, with northern breeders moving south within or somewhat beyond the breeding range. Other populations may only move altitudinally. This species is an improbable transatlantic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrancy_(biology)" title="Vagrancy (biology)">vagrant</a>, but there is an accepted western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> record in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> in 1982.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from August 2012">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
Nests in Alaska, Canada and mountains in Oregon and Washington. Prefers moist conifer forest. Most common in dense, older conifer forests in high elevations. Moves to lower elevations during the winter where it is often seen in towns and orchards and thickets, or migrates to California. Seen in flocks during winter of up to 20 birds. well known for individual birds to fly eastward in winter, showing up in just about any state, then returning to the West coast for breeding.
The Varied Thrush is predominantly insectivorous.
The breeding habitat is dense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">coniferous</a> forest, with two to five eggs being laid in a tree nest.
