<b>Newell's Shearwater</b> or <b>Hawaiian Shearwater</b> (<i>Puffinus newelli</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> belonging to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffinus" title="Puffinus">Puffinus</a></i> in the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procellariidae" title="Procellariidae">Procellariidae</a>. It belongs to a confusing group of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearwater" title="Shearwater">shearwaters</a> which are difficult to identify and whose classification is controversial. It was formerly treated as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_Shearwater" title="Manx Shearwater">Manx Shearwater</a> (<i>Puffinus puffinus</i>) and is now often placed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsend%27s_Shearwater" title="Townsend's Shearwater">Townsend's Shearwater</a> (<i>Puffinus auricularis</i>). It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism" title="Endemism">endemic</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands" title="Hawaiian Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a> as a breeding bird.

It is a fairly small shearwater, 33 centimetres (13&nbsp;in) in length. The wing is 223–249 millimetres (8.8–9.8 in) long and the tail is 78.9–88.8 millimetres (3.11–3.50 in). The bird weighs 0.340–0.425 kilogram (0.75–0.94 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The upperparts are black with a brown tinge while the underparts are white. The dark coloration on the face extends below the eye and is sharply separated from the white throat. There is a white patch on the flanks, extending onto the sides of the rump. The underwings are mainly white with a dark border. The undertail-coverts have a black and white pattern and appear white in the field. The bill is dark grey or brown and the legs and feet are mainly pale pink. The bird flies low over the water on stiff wings with a mixture of short glides and periods of rapid flapping. It utters a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey" title="Donkey">donkey</a>-like braying call around the breeding areas. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsend%27s_Shearwater" title="Townsend's Shearwater">Townsend's Shearwater</a> (<i>P. auricularis</i>) is very similar but has dark undertail-coverts, a shorter tail and a less sharp boundary between the black and white on the face.
It was described as a new species <i>Puffinus newelli</i> in 1900 by the American ornithologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wetherbee_Henshaw" title="Henry Wetherbee Henshaw">Henry Wetherbee Henshaw</a> using specimens obtained by Brother Matthias Newell from residents of Maui. It was later included by some authors in the Manx Shearwater (<i>Puffinus puffinus</i>) as was Townsend's Shearwater (<i>Puffinus auricularis</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Later, Townsends's Shearwater was raised back to species status with Newell's Shearwater as a subspecies of it. This taxonomy was followed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> from the sixth edition of its checklist onwards. However Newell's differs from Townsend's Shearwater in various measurements and has a different breeding season and marine habitat.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> It is now often treated as a separate species, e.g. by BirdLife International following Brooke (2004).<sup id="cite_ref-BLI_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BLI-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> In 2004, a study of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA" title="Mitochondrial DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> sequences suggested a close relationship between Rapa Shearwater and Newell's Shearwater and the authors proposed that Rapa Shearwater be treated as a subspecies of <i>P. newelli</i> pending further study.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The Rapa Shearwater is usually treated as a subspecies of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Shearwater" title="Little Shearwater">Little Shearwater</a> (<i>Puffinus assimilis</i>) and named <i>Puffinus assimilis myrtae</i>. It breeds on the island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapa_Iti" title="Rapa Iti">Rapa</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austral_Islands" title="Austral Islands">Austral Islands</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Polynesia" title="French Polynesia">French Polynesia</a> where it is known locally as the <i>kaki kaki</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
It breeds in at least 20 colonies on mountain slopes in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands" title="Hawaiian Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a>. The main colonies are on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauai" title="Kauai">Kaua<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i</a>, on slopes around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alakai_Wilderness_Preserve" title="Alakai Wilderness Preserve">Alaka<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i Plateau</a> and probably in the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Mokolea_Mountains&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mokolea Mountains (page does not exist)">Mokolea Mountains</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Its distribution on the other islands is uncertain but it is known to breed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molokai" title="Molokai">Moloka<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_(island)" title="Hawaii (island)">island of Hawai<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i</a> and may breed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oahu" title="Oahu">O<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ahu</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui" title="Maui">Maui</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanai" title="Lanai">Lāna<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> From April to November it can be seen in the waters around the Hawaiian Islands, particularly around Kaua<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i. Outside the breeding season it disperses into the tropical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. Its distribution at sea is little known but many move south and east into the waters of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Counter_Current" title="Equatorial Counter Current">Equatorial Counter Current</a>. It has been recorded as far west as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Islands" title="Mariana Islands">Mariana Islands</a>. In the south there are records from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa" title="Samoa">Samoa</a> in September 1977 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Samoa" title="American Samoa">American Samoa</a> in January 1993.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
It feeds far from land, in areas of deep water (at least 2000 metres). Its diet is little known but includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid" title="Squid">squid</a> and small fish. It dives into the water to catch its prey, swimming down to a depth of up to 10 metres using its wings to move forward. It is attracted to schools of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuna" title="Tuna">tuna</a> and gathers in flocks with other seabird species to catch prey driven to the surface by the tuna.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
By 1908, it was thought to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction" title="Extinction">extinct</a> but was rediscovered in 1947 and found breeding on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauai" title="Kauai">Kaua<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i</a> in 1967. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest" title="Nest">nest</a> site is a burrow dug into a steep slope, usually sheltered by <i>uluhe</i> (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicranopteris_linearis" title="Dicranopteris linearis">Dicranopteris linearis</a></i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern" title="Fern">ferns</a>). A single white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">egg</a> is laid during the first two weeks of June. Both parents <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubate</a> the egg and an incubation period of 62 days has been recorded. The young birds leave the nest in October, 88-100 days after hatching. They fly out to sea and are no longer dependent on their parents.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
It was formerly a much commoner bird with a wider breeding distribution in the islands. It has declined due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_loss" title="Habitat loss" class="mw-redirect">habitat loss</a> and predation by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species" title="Introduced species">introduced species</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoose" title="Mongoose">mongooses</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_Owl" title="Barn Owl">Barn Owls</a>. Young birds in particular are attracted to the lights of urban areas at night and many die in collisions with power lines and buildings. The population was estimated at 84,000 birds in the mid-1990s. A severe decline has occurred in recent years which may be associated with the effects of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Iniki" title="Hurricane Iniki">Hurricane Iniki</a> in 1992.<sup id="cite_ref-BLI_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BLI-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
