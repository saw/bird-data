The <b>Barn Swallow</b> (<i>Hirundo rustica</i>) is the most widespread species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow" title="Swallow">swallow</a> in the world.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It is a distinctive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail" title="Tail">tail</a> and curved, pointed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_flight#Wing" title="Bird flight">wings</a>. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_world" title="English-speaking world">Anglophone</a> Europe it is just called the <b>Swallow</b>; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a "swallow" rather than a "martin".<sup id="cite_ref-GillAndWright_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GillAndWright-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
There are six subspecies of Barn Swallow, which breed across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere" title="Northern Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>. Four are strongly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, and their wintering grounds cover much of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" title="Southern Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a> as far south as central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Province" title="Cape Province">Cape Province</a> of South Africa, and northern Australia.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Its huge range means that the Barn Swallow is not endangered, although there may be local population declines due to specific threats.
The Barn Swallow is a bird of open country which normally uses man-made structures to breed and consequently has spread with human expansion. It builds a cup <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> from mud pellets in barns or similar structures and feeds on insects caught in flight.<sup id="cite_ref-BWP_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BWP-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> This species lives in close association with humans, and its insect-eating habits mean that it is tolerated by man; this acceptance was reinforced in the past by superstitions regarding the bird and its nest. There are frequent cultural references to the Barn Swallow in literary and religious works due to both its living in close proximity to humans and its annual migration.<sup id="cite_ref-Cocker_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cocker-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The Barn Swallow is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_birds" title="List of national birds">national bird</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia" title="Estonia">Estonia</a>.
The adult male Barn Swallow of the nominate subspecies <i>H. r. rustica</i> is 17–19&nbsp;cm (6.7–7.5&nbsp;in) long including 2–7&nbsp;cm (0.8–2.8&nbsp;in) of elongated outer tail feathers. It has a wingspan of 32–34.5&nbsp;cm (12.6–13.6&nbsp;in) and weighs 16–22&nbsp;g (0.56–0.78&nbsp;oz). It has steel blue upperparts and a rufous forehead, chin and throat, which are separated from the off-white underparts by a broad dark blue breast band. The outer tail feathers are elongated, giving the distinctive deeply forked "swallow tail." There is a line of white spots across the outer end of the upper tail.<sup id="cite_ref-BWP_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BWP-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The female is similar in appearance to the male, but the tail streamers are shorter, the blue of the upperparts and breast band is less glossy, and the underparts more pale. The juvenile is browner and has a paler rufous face and whiter underparts. It also lacks the long tail streamers of the adult.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The song of the Barn Swallow is a cheerful warble, often ending with <i>su-seer</i> with the second note higher than the first but falling in pitch. Calls include <i>witt</i> or <i>witt-witt</i> and a loud <i>splee-plink</i> when excited (or trying to chase intruders away from the nest).<sup id="cite_ref-BWP_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BWP-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_call" title="Alarm call" class="mw-redirect">alarm calls</a> include a sharp <i>siflitt</i> for predators like cats and a <i>flitt-flitt</i> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">birds of prey</a> like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby_(bird)" title="Hobby (bird)">Hobby</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Mullarney_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mullarney-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> This species is fairly quiet on the wintering grounds.<sup id="cite_ref-Hilty_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hilty-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The distinctive combination of a red face and blue breast band render the adult Barn Swallow easy to distinguish from the African <i>Hirundo</i> species and from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_Swallow" title="Welcome Swallow">Welcome Swallow</a> (<i>Hirundo neoxena</i>) with which its range overlaps in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia" title="Australasia">Australasia</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> In Africa the short tail streamers of the juvenile Barn Swallow invite confusion with juvenile <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-chested_Swallow" title="Red-chested Swallow">Red-chested Swallow</a> (<i>Hirundo lucida</i>), but the latter has a narrower breast band and more white in the tail.<sup id="cite_ref-Barlow_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Barlow-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Barn Swallow was described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus" title="Carl Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae" title="Systema Naturae">Systema Naturae</a></i> in 1758 as <i>Hirundo rustica</i>, characterised as <i>H. rectricibus, exceptis duabus intermediis, macula alba notatîs</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>Hirundo</i> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for "swallow"; <i>rusticus</i> means "of the country."<sup id="cite_ref-name_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-name-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> This species is the only one of that genus to have a range extending into the Americas, with the majority of <i>Hirundo</i> species being native to Africa.

The <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a></i> dates the English <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_name" title="Common name">common name</a> "barn swallow" to 1851, though an earlier instance of the collocation in an English-language context is in Gilbert White's popular book <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Natural_History_and_Antiquities_of_Selborne" title="The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne">The Natural History of Selborne</a></i>, originally published in 1789:
The swallow, though called the chimney-swallow, by no means builds altogether in chimnies  [<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic" title="Sic">sic</a></i>], but often within barns and out-houses against the rafters... In <i>Sweden</i> she builds in barns, and is called <i>ladu swala</i>, the barn-swallow.<sup id="cite_ref-white_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-white-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
This suggests that the English name may be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calque" title="Calque">calque</a> on the Swedish term.
There are few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy" title="Taxonomy">taxonomic</a> problems within the genus, but the Red-chested Swallow—a resident of West Africa, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_River" title="Congo River">Congo basin</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>—was formerly treated as a subspecies of Barn Swallow. The Red-chested Swallow is slightly smaller than its migratory relative, has a narrower blue breast-band, and the adult has shorter tail streamers. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_flight" title="Bird flight">flight</a>, it looks paler underneath than Barn Swallow.<sup id="cite_ref-Barlow_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Barlow-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
Six subspecies of Barn Swallow are generally recognized. In eastern Asia, a number of additional or alternative forms have been proposed, including <i>saturata</i> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ridgway" title="Robert Ridgway">Robert Ridgway</a> in 1883,<sup id="cite_ref-ssp_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ssp-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>kamtschatica</i> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedykt_Dybowski" title="Benedykt Dybowski">Benedykt Dybowski</a> in 1883,<sup id="cite_ref-Dickinson_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dickinson-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>ambigua</i> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Stresemann" title="Erwin Stresemann">Erwin Stresemann</a><sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> and <i>mandschurica</i> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Meise" title="Wilhelm Meise">Wilhelm Meise</a> in 1934.<sup id="cite_ref-ssp_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ssp-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Given the uncertainties over the validity of these forms,<sup id="cite_ref-Dickinson_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dickinson-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> this article follows the treatment of Turner and Rose.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Unexpectedly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> analyses show that Barn Swallows from North America colonised the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal" title="Lake Baikal">Baikal</a> region of Siberia, a dispersal direction opposite to that for most changes in distribution between North America and Eurasia.<sup id="cite_ref-Williams_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Williams-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup>
The preferred habitat of the Barn Swallow is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, preferably with nearby water. This swallow avoids heavily wooded or precipitous areas and densely built-up locations. The presence of accessible open structures such as barns, stables, or culverts to provide nesting sites, and exposed locations such as wires, roof ridges or bare branches for perching, are also important in the bird's selection of its breeding range.<sup id="cite_ref-BWP_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BWP-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
It breeds in the Northern Hemisphere from sea level to typically 2,700 metres (8,900&nbsp;ft),<sup id="cite_ref-BirdLife2_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdLife2-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> but to 3,000 metres (9,800&nbsp;ft) in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a><sup id="cite_ref-BWP_4-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BWP-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> and North America,<sup id="cite_ref-umich_26-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> and it is absent only from deserts and the cold northernmost parts of the continents. Over much of its range, it avoids towns, and in Europe is replaced in urban areas by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Martin" title="House Martin" class="mw-redirect">House Martin</a>. However, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honsh%C5%AB" title="Honshū" class="mw-redirect">Honshū</a>, the Barn Swallow is a more urban bird, with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-rumped_Swallow" title="Red-rumped Swallow">Red-rumped Swallow</a> (<i>Cecropis daurica</i>) replacing it as the rural species.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
In winter, the Barn Swallow is cosmopolitan in its choice of habitat, avoiding only dense forests and deserts.<sup id="cite_ref-SASOL_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SASOL-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> It is most common in open, low vegetation habitats, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savanna</a> and ranch land, and in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, South Africa and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago" title="Trinidad and Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> it is described as being particularly attracted to burnt or harvested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarcane" title="Sugarcane">sugarcane</a> fields and the waste from the cane.<sup id="cite_ref-Hilty_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hilty-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-mercy_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mercy-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ffrench_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ffrench-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> In the absence of suitable roost sites, they may sometimes roost on wires where they are more exposed to predators.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> Individual birds tend to return to the same wintering locality each year<sup id="cite_ref-burton_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-burton-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> and congregate from a large area to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_roosting" title="Communal roosting">roost</a> in reed beds.<sup id="cite_ref-mercy_28-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mercy-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> These roosts can be extremely large, one in Nigeria had an estimated 1.5 million birds.<sup id="cite_ref-Bijlsma_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bijlsma-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> These roosts are thought to be a protection from predators, and the arrival of roosting birds is synchronised in order to overwhelm predators like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Hobby" title="African Hobby">African Hobbies</a>. The Barn Swallow has been recorded as breeding in the more temperate parts of its winter range, such as the mountains of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> and in central Argentina.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Lekagul_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lekagul-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup>
Migration of Barn Swallows between Britain and South Africa was first established on 23 December 1912 when a bird that had been ringed by James Masefield at a nest in Staffordshire, was found in Natal.<sup id="cite_ref-MigrationAtlas_34-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-MigrationAtlas-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> As would be expected for a long-distance migrant, this bird has occurred as a vagrant to such distant areas as Hawaii, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, Greenland, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_da_Cunha" title="Tristan da Cunha">Tristan da Cunha</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Barn Swallow is similar in its habits to other aerial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivore" title="Insectivore">insectivores</a>, including other swallow species and the unrelated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift" title="Swift">swifts</a>. It is not a particularly fast flier, with a speed estimated at about 11&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_per_second" title="Metre per second">m/s</a>, up to 20&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_per_second" title="Metre per second">m/s</a> and a wing beat rate of approximately 5, up to 7–9 times each second,<sup id="cite_ref-flight_35-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-flight-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Park_36-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Park-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> but it has the manoeuvrability necessary to feed on flying insects while airborne. It is often seen flying relatively low in open or semi-open areas.
The Barn Swallow typically feeds 7–8&nbsp;metres (23–26&nbsp;ft) above shallow water or the ground, often following animals, humans or farm machinery to catch disturbed insects, but it will occasionally pick prey items from the water surface, walls and plants. In the breeding areas, large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly" title="Fly">flies</a> make up around 70% of the diet, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphid" title="Aphid">aphids</a> also a significant component. However, in Europe, the Barn Swallow consumes fewer aphids than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Martin" title="House Martin" class="mw-redirect">House</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Martin" title="Sand Martin">Sand Martins</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-BWP_4-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BWP-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> On the wintering grounds, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenoptera" title="Hymenoptera">Hymenoptera</a>, especially flying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ants</a>, are important food items. When egg-laying, Barn Swallows hunt in pairs, but will form often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_size_measures" title="Group size measures">large flocks</a> otherwise.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope" title="Isotope">Isotope</a> studies have shown that wintering populations may utilise different feeding habitats, with British breeders feeding mostly over grassland, whereas <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Swiss</a> birds utilised woodland more.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans_37-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Evans-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> Another study showed that a single population breeding in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> actually wintered in two separate and different areas.<sup id="cite_ref-Mollerhobson_38-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mollerhobson-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Barn Swallow drinks by skimming low over lakes or rivers and scooping up water with its open mouth.<sup id="cite_ref-umich_26-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> This bird bathes in a similar fashion, dipping into the water for an instant while in flight.<sup id="cite_ref-burton_31-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-burton-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup>
Swallows gather in communal roosts after breeding, sometimes thousands strong. Reed beds are regularly favoured, with the birds swirling <i>en masse</i> before swooping low over the reeds.<sup id="cite_ref-Mullarney_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mullarney-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Reed beds are an important source of food prior to and whilst on migration; although the Barn Swallow is a diurnal migrant which can feed on the wing whilst it travels low over ground or water, the reed beds enable fat deposits to be established or replenished.<sup id="cite_ref-Euring_39-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Euring-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup>
The male Barn Swallow returns to the breeding grounds before the females and selects a nest site, which is then advertised to females with a circling flight and song. The breeding success of the male is related to the length of the tail streamers, with longer streamers being more attractive to the female.<sup id="cite_ref-BWP_4-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BWP-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Saino_40-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Saino-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> Males with longer tail feathers are generally longer-lived and more disease resistant, females thus gaining an indirect fitness benefit from this form of selection, since longer tail feathers indicate a genetically stronger individual which will produce offspring with enhanced vitality.<sup id="cite_ref-Moller_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Moller-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> Males in northern Europe have longer tails than those further south; whereas in Spain the male's tail streamers are only 5% longer than the female's, in Finland the difference is 20%. In Denmark, the average male tail length increased by 9% between 1984 and 2004, but it is possible that climatic changes may lead in the future to shorter tails if summers become hot and dry.<sup id="cite_ref-BB102_42-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BB102-42"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup>
Males with long streamers also have larger white tail spots, and since feather-eating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_louse" title="Chewing louse" class="mw-redirect">bird lice</a> prefer white feathers, large white tail spots without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism" title="Parasitism">parasite</a> damage again demonstrate breeding quality; there is a positive association between spot size and the number of offspring produced each season.<sup id="cite_ref-Kose_43-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kose-43"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup>
Both sexes defend the nest, but the male is particularly aggressive and territorial.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Once established, pairs stay together to breed for life, but extra-pair <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating" title="Mating">copulation</a> is common, making this species <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene" title="Gene">genetically</a> polygamous, despite being socially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy" title="Monogamy">monogamous</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> Males guard females actively to avoid being cuckolded.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> Males may use deceptive alarm calls to disrupt extrapair copulation attempts toward their mates.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup>
As its name implies, the Barn Swallow typically nests inside accessible buildings such as barns and stables, or under bridges and wharves. The neat cup-shaped nest is placed on a beam or against a suitable vertical projection. It is constructed by both sexes, although more often by the female, with mud pellets collected in their beaks and lined with grasses, feathers, algae<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> or other soft materials.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Barn Swallows may nest colonially where sufficient high-quality nest sites are available, and within a colony, each pair defends a territory around the nest which, for the European subspecies, is four to eight square metres (45 to 90 square feet) in size. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_size_measures" title="Group size measures">Colony size</a> tends to be larger in North America.<sup id="cite_ref-umich_26-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup>
In North America at least, Barn Swallows frequently engage in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(biology)" title="Mutualism (biology)">mutualist</a> relationship with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osprey" title="Osprey">Ospreys</a>. Barn Swallows will build their nest below an Osprey nest, receiving protection from other birds of prey which are repelled by the exclusively fish-eating Ospreys. The Ospreys are alerted to the presence of these predators by the alarm calls of the swallows.<sup id="cite_ref-umich_26-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup>
Before man-made sites became common, the Barn Swallow nested on cliff faces or in caves, but this is now rare. The female lays two to seven, but typically four or five, reddish-spotted white eggs. The eggs are 20&nbsp;x&nbsp;14&nbsp;millimetres (0.6&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.8 in) in size, and weigh 1.9&nbsp;grammes (0.07&nbsp;oz), of which 5 percent is shell. In Europe, the female does almost all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubation</a>, but in North America the male may incubate up to 25% of the time. The incubation period is normally 14–19 days, with another 18–23 days before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" title="Altricial">altricial</a> chicks fledge. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, first-year birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Barn Swallow will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing_behavior" title="Mobbing behavior" class="mw-redirect">mob</a> intruders such as cats or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter" title="Accipiter">accipiters</a> that venture too close to their nest, often flying very close to the threat.<sup id="cite_ref-Moller_41-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Moller-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> Adult Barn Swallows have few predators, but some are taken by accipiters, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon" title="Falcon">falcons</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owls</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite" title="Brood parasite">Brood parasitism</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowbird" title="Cowbird">cowbirds</a> in North America or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo" title="Cuckoo">cuckoos</a> in Eurasia is rare.<sup id="cite_ref-BWP_4-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BWP-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-umich_26-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup>
There are normally two broods, with the original nest being reused for the second brood and being repaired and reused in subsequent years. Hatching success is 90% and the fledging survival rate is 70–90%. Average mortality is 70–80% in the first year and 40–70% for the adult. Although the record age is more than 11 years, most survive less than four years.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Barn Swallow nestlings have prominent red gapes, a feature shown to induce feeding by parent birds. An experiment in manipulating brood size and immune system showed the vividness of the gape was positively correlated with T-cell–mediated immunocompetence, and that larger brood size and injection with an antigen led to a less vivid gape.<sup id="cite_ref-Saino03_48-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Saino03-48"><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup>

Barn Swallows (and other small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerines" title="Passerines" class="mw-redirect">passerines</a>) often have characteristic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather_holes" title="Feather holes" class="mw-redirect">feather holes</a> on their wing and tail feathers.

The Barn Swallow has an enormous range, with an estimated global extent of 51.7&nbsp;million&nbsp;square kilometres (19.96&nbsp;million square miles) and a population of 190 million individuals. Although global population trends have not been quantified, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List</a> (that is, declining more than 30 percent in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as "least concern" on the 2007 IUCN Red List,<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> and has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES" title="CITES">CITES</a>), which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants.<sup id="cite_ref-umich_26-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup>
This is a species which has greatly benefited historically from forest clearance, which has created the open habitats it prefers, and from human habitation, which have given it an abundance of safe man-made nest sites. There have been local declines due to the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">DDT</a> in Israel in the 1950s, competition for nest sites with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Sparrow" title="House Sparrow">House Sparrows</a> in the US in the 19th century, and an ongoing gradual decline in numbers in parts of Europe and Asia due to agricultural intensification, reducing the availability of insect food. However, there has been an increase in the population in North America during the 20th century with the greater availability of nesting sites and subsequent range expansion, including the colonisation of northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta" title="Alberta">Alberta</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_2-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
A specific threat to wintering birds from the European populations is the transformation by the South African government of a light aircraft runway near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durban" title="Durban">Durban</a> into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Shaka_International_Airport" title="King Shaka International Airport">an international airport</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup" title="2010 FIFA World Cup">2010 FIFA World Cup</a>. The roughly 250 metres (275 yards) square Mount Moreland reed bed is a night roost for more than three million Barn Swallows, which represent one percent of the global population and eight percent of the European breeding population. The reed bed lies on the flight path of aircraft using the proposed La Mercy airport, and there were fears that it would be cleared because the birds could threaten aircraft safety.<sup id="cite_ref-Guardian_54-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guardian-54"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-BirdLife2_25-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdLife2-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> However, following detailed evaluation, advanced radar technology will be installed to enable planes using the airport to be warned of bird movements and, if necessary, take appropriate measures to avoid the flocks.<sup id="cite_ref-mercy_28-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mercy-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">Climate change</a> may affect the Barn Swallow; drought causes weight loss and slow feather regrowth, and the expansion of the Sahara will make it a more formidable obstacle for migrating European birds. Hot dry summers will reduce the availability of insect food for chicks. Conversely, warmer springs may lengthen the breeding season and result in more chicks, and the opportunity to use nest sites outside buildings in the north of the range might also lead to more offspring.<sup id="cite_ref-BB102_42-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BB102-42"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Barn Swallow is an attractive bird which feeds on flying insects and has therefore been tolerated by humans when it shares their buildings for nesting. As one of the earlier migrants, this conspicuous species is also seen as an early sign of summer's approach.<sup id="cite_ref-Welldon_55-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Welldon-55"><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup>
In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World" title="Old World">Old World</a>, the Barn Swallow appears to have used man-made structures and bridges since time immemorial.<sup id="cite_ref-Turner2_56-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner2-56"><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> An early reference is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgics" title="Georgics">Georgics</a></i> (29 BC) <i>...garrula quam tignis nidum suspendat hirundo</i> (...the twittering swallow hangs its nest from the rafters).<sup id="cite_ref-Virgil_57-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Virgil-57"><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup>
It is believed that the Barn Swallow began attaching its nest to Native American habitations in the early 19th century, and the subsequent spread of settlement across North America is thought to have resulted in a dramatic population expansion of the species across the continent.<sup id="cite_ref-Williams_24-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Williams-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup>
Many cattle farmers believed that swallows spread <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella" title="Salmonella">Salmonella</a></i> infections, however a study in Sweden showed no evidence of the birds being reservoirs of the bacteria.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58"><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup>
Many literary references are based on the Barn Swallow's northward migration as a symbol of spring or summer. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proverb" title="Proverb">proverb</a> about the necessity for more than one piece of evidence goes back at least to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics" title="Nicomachean Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a></i>: "For as one swallow or one day does not make a spring, so one day or a short time does not make a fortunate or happy man."<sup id="cite_ref-Welldon_55-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Welldon-55"><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Barn Swallow symbolizes the coming of spring and thus love in the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervigilium_Veneris" title="Pervigilium Veneris">Pervigilium Veneris</a></i>, a late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> poem.

There are mentions of the Barn Swallow in the Bible, although it seems likely that it is confused with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift" title="Swift">swifts</a> in many translations,<sup id="cite_ref-bible_60-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bible-60"><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup> or possibly other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow" title="Swallow">hirundine species</a> which breed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Mullarney_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mullarney-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> However, "Yea, the sparrow hath found her a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young" from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Psalms&amp;verse=84:3&amp;src=!">Psalms 84:3</a> likely applies to the Barn Swallow.<sup id="cite_ref-bible_60-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bible-60"><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup>
The swallow is also notably cited in several of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s plays for the swiftness of its flight; for example: "True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings ..." from Act 5 of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III_(play)" title="Richard III (play)">Richard III</a></i>, and "I have horse will follow where the game Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain." from the second act of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Andronicus" title="Titus Andronicus">Titus Andronicus</a></i>.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_White" title="Gilbert White">Gilbert White</a> studied the Barn Swallow in detail in his pioneering work <i>The Natural History of Selborne</i>, but even this careful observer was uncertain whether it migrated or hibernated in winter.<sup id="cite_ref-white_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-white-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Elsewhere, its long journeys have been well-observed, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow_tattoo" title="Swallow tattoo">swallow tattoo</a> is popular amongst nautical men as a symbol of a safe return; the tradition was that a mariner had a tattoo of this fellow wanderer after sailing 5,000 nautical miles (9,260&nbsp;km, 5,755 statute miles).

In the past, the tolerance for this beneficial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivore" title="Insectivore">insectivore</a> was reinforced by superstitions regarding damage to the Barn Swallow's nest.
