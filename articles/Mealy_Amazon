The <b>Mealy Amazon</b> or <b>Mealy Parrot</b> (<i>Amazona farinosa</i>) is among the largest parrots in the <i>Amazona</i> genus, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_parrot" title="Amazon parrot">Amazon parrots</a>. It is a mainly green <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot" title="Parrot">parrot</a> with a total length of 38–41&nbsp;cm (15–16&nbsp;in). It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism" title="Endemism">endemic</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical" title="Tropical" class="mw-redirect">tropical</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>.
The Mealy Amazon occurs in tropical Central America and South America. It frequents humid to semi-humid forest (only rarely in deciduous forest) and plantations. In regions dominated by open/dry habitats it is restricted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_forest" title="Gallery forest">gallery forest</a> or completely absent.
Several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> have been described and these have alternative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_name" title="Common name">common names</a> that are used frequently in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviculture" title="Aviculture">aviculture</a>:

The Mealy Amazon has a total length of about 38–41&nbsp;cm (15–16&nbsp;in)<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and weighs 540-700 g (19.01-24.64&nbsp;oz). Captives commonly are heavier. It is among the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrots" title="Parrots" class="mw-redirect">parrots</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a>, mainly being surpassed by the large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaws" title="Macaws" class="mw-redirect">macaws</a>. It has a relatively short and squarish tail, as do the other members of the <i>Amazona</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a>.
The Mealy Amazon is mainly green. The back and nape often have a whitish tinge; almost as if it had been covered in a thin layer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a> ("meal"; hence its name). The distal half of the tail is paler and more yellow than the basal half, thus resulting in a distinctly bi-coloured look. In flight it shows a bluish-black trailing edge to the wing and a conspicuous red <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculum_feathers" title="Speculum feathers">speculum</a>. Occasionally a few yellow feathers are apparent on the top of the head and two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>, <i>virenticeps</i> and <i>guatemalae</i>, have a bluish-tinged crown. The maroon to orange eyes (typically appear dark from a distance) are surrounded by a relatively broad white eye-ring of bare skin.
In South America, it is commonly confused with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-crowned_Amazon" title="Yellow-crowned Amazon">Yellow-crowned Amazon</a>, but can be recognized by its larger size, less yellow to the crown (not entirely reliable, as some Yellow-crowned may show almost none), the whitish tinge to its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a>, broader white eye-ring, and red of the leading edge of the wing placed near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather#Remiges" title="Flight feather">phalanx</a> (not near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather#Remiges" title="Flight feather">radiale</a>), but this is often difficult to see (especially on perched birds). Their voices are also strikingly different.
The Mealy Amazon is social and can be found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairs" title="Pairs" class="mw-redirect">pairs</a> or in large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flock_(birds)" title="Flock (birds)">flocks</a>. They are even known to interact with other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot" title="Parrot">parrots</a>, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaw" title="Macaw">macaws</a>. They are usually quiet but can be loud at dusk and dawn. In captivity, they are known as one of the gentlest and calmest of all amazons.
The diet of the Mealy Amazon consists mostly of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry" title="Berry">berries</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(fruit)" title="Nut (fruit)">nuts</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blossom" title="Blossom">blossoms</a>, and leaf buds.
After Mealy Amazons reach <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity" title="Sexual maturity">sexual maturity</a> they usually form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy" title="Monogamy">monogamous</a> relationships with a single partner. Each year courtship usually begins in early spring, and the female will usually lay three or four white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> in tree-cavity nest. The female <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubates</a> the eggs for about 26 days. The male <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)" title="Regurgitation (digestion)">regurgitates</a> food for the female during the incubation period, and later for the chicks in the nest as well. The chicks leave the nest about 60 days after hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-DA_2003_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DA_2003-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
It is fairly common in most of its range, but has declined locally due to habitat loss and trapping for wild parrot trade. Trafficking of the birds (as for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_pet" title="Exotic pet">exotic pets</a>) is illegal in many nations, but the species are still smuggled into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. In some areas Mealy Amazons are hunted as food. The Mealy Amazon sometimes feeds on human crops (especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">corn</a>) and may be considered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(animal)" title="Pest (animal)" class="mw-redirect">crop pest</a>.
The Mealy Amazon is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_breeding" title="Captive breeding">bred in captivity</a> with some regularity.
