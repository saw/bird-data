This bird's song is a buzzy <i>tik tuk zee</i>, resembling the sound made by a grasshopper. Unlike some other members of the Ammodramus family of sparrows, they will readily sing from open and exposed perches. Like many grassland birds, this bird's numbers have declined across many parts of its range, including a 98% drop in New York State.
