The <b>Black Phoebe</b> (<i>Sayornis nigricans</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> bird in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant-flycatcher" title="Tyrant-flycatcher" class="mw-redirect">tyrant-flycatcher</a> family. It breeds from southwest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon" title="Oregon">Oregon</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> south through Central and South America. It occurs year-round throughout most of its range and migrates less than the other birds in its genus, though its northern populations are partially migratory. Six <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> are commonly recognized, although two are occasionally combined as separate species, the White-winged Phoebe.
The Black Pheobe has predominately black plumage, with a white belly and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_(feather)#Tail-coverts" title="Covert (feather)" class="mw-redirect">undertail coverts</a>. The sexes are identical in color, and juveniles have brown feather tips and brown wing-bars. Its song is a repeated <i>tee-hee, tee ho</i>. It lives in a variety of habitats but is always near water. It is mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivorous" title="Insectivorous" class="mw-redirect">insectivorous</a>, and waits on a perch before flying out and catching its prey in the air. It makes an open cup nest which is placed under a cliff or a bridge and cemented in its place with mud.
The Black Phoebe is a medium-sized flycatcher, being 16 centimeters (6.3&nbsp;in) in length and weighing 15 to 22 grams (0.5 to 0.8 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-AAB_Life_History_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AAB_Life_History-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It has predominately black plumage, with white on its belly and undertail coverts. The white forms an inverted 'V' in the lower breast. The sexes are identical, and plumage does not vary seasonally. Juveniles have browner plumage, cinnamon-brown feather tips on their body, and brown wing-bars. The bird has brown irises, and black legs, feet, and beak.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_Description_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA_Description-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The phoebe can be recognized by a characteristic 'tail-wagging' motion, in which the tail is lowered and fanned, then slowely .<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> It accomplishes almost all locomotion by flight, which is direct, with steady wing beats.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_Behavior_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA_Behavior-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Its song consists of two alternating phrases (<i>tee-hee, tee-ho</i> or <i>sisee, sitsew</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-Sibley_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sibley-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The song can be heard from both sexes, but is more commonly sung by males.<sup id="cite_ref-Smith_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The phoebes are a genus, <i>Sayorins</i>, of birds in the Tyrant Flycatcher family. The flycatchers are the largest family of birds on earth, with over 400 known species.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The genus name was given by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Robert_Gray" title="George Robert Gray">George Robert Gray</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum" title="British Museum">British Museum</a>, and is named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Say" title="Thomas Say">Thomas Say</a>, an American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalist" title="Naturalist" class="mw-redirect">naturalist</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> The species name, <i>nigricans</i>, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> for "<i>blackish</i>",<sup id="cite_ref-LatinSmith_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LatinSmith-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> and was given by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_John_Swainson" title="William John Swainson">William John Swainson</a> in 1827.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Black Phoebe has six subspecies, but these can be divided into two groups which are sometimes considered to be separate species: the <i>nigricans</i> group (Black Phoebe) and the <i>latirostris</i> group (White-winged Phoebe).<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> The first group contains four subspecies; the second group two.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_Systematics_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA_Systematics-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Black Phoebe breeds in the west and southwest United States, Mexico and Central America, and parts of South America. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon" title="Oregon">Oregon</a> it is found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_valley" title="River valley" class="mw-redirect">river valleys</a> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_coast" title="Pacific coast">Pacific coast</a>, and in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> on the western side of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_Ranges" title="Coast Ranges" class="mw-redirect">Coast Ranges</a>. It breeds throughout the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River" title="Colorado River">Colorado River</a> valley, and occasionally is found to the north in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> and southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a>, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> and central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>. In Central America it breeds on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California" title="Baja California">Baja California</a>, except for the central part of the peninsula, and on interior mainland Mexico southwest to Panama, excluding El Salvador. In South America it is found in the coastal mountains of Venezuela, through Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, to western Bolivia and northwestern Argentina.
It lives year-round in most of its range and is more sedentary than either of the other phoebes in its genus (Eastern or Say's), although northern populations may be partially migratory. It is always found near water, and is often found at coastal cliffs, river/lake banks, or even park fountains. Habitats must also include a supply of mud for nest building, and the birds' specialized nesting requirements probably cause their somewhat irregular range.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
