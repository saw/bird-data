The <b>Bermuda Petrel</b>, <i>Pterodroma cahow</i>, is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadfly_petrel" title="Gadfly petrel">gadfly</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrel" title="Petrel">petrel</a>. Commonly known in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> as the <b>Cahow</b>, a name derived from its eerie cries, this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal" title="Nocturnal" class="mw-redirect">nocturnal</a> ground-nesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> is the national bird of Bermuda, and a symbol of hope for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature" title="Nature">nature</a> conservation. It was thought <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct" title="Extinct" class="mw-redirect">extinct</a> for 330 years. Its dramatic rediscovery as a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_taxon" title="Lazarus taxon">Lazarus species</a>", that is, a species found to be alive after being considered extinct for centuries, has inspired documentary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmakers" title="Filmmakers" class="mw-redirect">filmmakers</a>.
Initially superabundant throughout the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago" title="Archipelago">archipelago</a>, the Cahow is a slow breeder, but excellent flier, and spends its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult" title="Adult">adult</a> life on the open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea" title="Sea">seas</a>. At five years old it returns to its former nesting place and begins breeding, laying only one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">egg</a> per season. Cahows mate for life.
The Cahows' eerie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal" title="Nocturnal" class="mw-redirect">nocturnal</a> cries stopped the early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_people" title="Spanish people">Spanish</a> seafarers settling the islands out of superstition, as they thought the isles were inhabited by devils. Instead they put ashore hogs as a living foodstore for passing ships, and so began the onslaught on the Cahow's existence. Following Bermuda's colonisation by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">English</a>, introduced species like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rats" title="Rats" class="mw-redirect">rats</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats" title="Cats" class="mw-redirect">cats</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogs" title="Dogs" class="mw-redirect">dogs</a>, and mass killings of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds" title="Birds" class="mw-redirect">birds</a> by early colonists decimated numbers. Despite being protected by one of the world's earliest conservation decrees, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Bermuda" title="Governor of Bermuda">Governor</a>'s proclamation "against the spoyle and havocke of the Cohowes," the birds were thought to have been driven to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction" title="Extinction">extinction</a> since the 1620s.
In 1951, 18 surviving nesting pairs were found on rocky <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets" title="Islets" class="mw-redirect">islets</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Harbor,_Bermuda" title="Castle Harbor, Bermuda" class="mw-redirect">Castle Harbour</a> by American ornithologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cushman_Murphy" title="Robert Cushman Murphy">Robert Cushman Murphy</a> and Bermudian naturalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_L._Mowbray" title="Louis L. Mowbray">Louis L. Mowbray</a>. Along on the trip was a 15-year-old Bermudian boy named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_B._Wingate" title="David B. Wingate">David B. Wingate</a>, who devoted his life to saving the bird and in 1966 became Bermuda's first conservation officer. Wingate set up a program to build concrete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrow" title="Burrow">burrows</a> and wooden bafflers for the nesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel" title="Tunnel">tunnels</a> in order to keep out the slightly larger, competing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-tailed_tropicbird" title="White-tailed tropicbird" class="mw-redirect">'Bermuda longtail'</a>, and restored nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsuch_Island,_Bermuda" title="Nonsuch Island, Bermuda">Nonsuch Island</a> to be a future viable base for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a>.
Enjoying legal protection, the species has started to make a good recovery, the main threat for the future is lack of suitable breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_(ecology)" title="Habitat (ecology)" class="mw-redirect">habitat</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Fabian" title="Hurricane Fabian">Hurricane Fabian</a> destroyed many nesting burrows in 2003, and recently the larger and ecologically-restored <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsuch_Island,_Bermuda" title="Nonsuch Island, Bermuda">Nonsuch Island</a> is being repopulated with chicks, their translocation timed so they will imprint on these surroundings.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2008/03/Bermuda_Petrel.html">[1]</a> This work is being undertaken by the present Bermuda Conservation Officer <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jeremy_Madeiros&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jeremy Madeiros (page does not exist)">Jeremy Madeiros</a> assisted by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian" title="Australian" class="mw-redirect">Australian</a> petrel specialist <a href="/w/index.php?title=Nicholas_Carlile&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Nicholas Carlile (page does not exist)">Nick Carlile</a>. Nonetheless, the global population of this bird in 2005 was only about 250 individuals.
