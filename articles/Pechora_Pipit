The <b>Pechora Pipit</b> (<i>Anthus gustavi</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> which breeds in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a> of northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, eastwards of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>. It is a long-distance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrant</a>, moving in winter to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. Rarely in September and October, the Pechora Pipit may be observed in western Europe.
<i>A. gustavi</i> is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipit" title="Pipit">pipit</a>, which somewhat resembles the non-breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-throated_Pipit" title="Red-throated Pipit">Red-throated Pipit</a>. The species is heavily streaked brown above, with whitish mantle stripes, and with black markings on a white belly and buff breast below. It can be distinguished from Red-throated by its heavier bill, whiter mantle stripes, and contrast between its buff breast and white belly.
This species creeps in long grass, and is reluctant to fly even when disturbed. Its call is a distinctive electrical <i>zip</i>. Although the call is generally helpful when identifying pipits, this species calls far less than most. This, combined with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skulking" title="Skulking" class="mw-redirect">skulking</a> habits, makes this a difficult species to find and identify away from its breeding grounds in the Arctic.
Probably the best place in western Europe to see this rare species is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Isle" title="Fair Isle">Fair Isle</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland_Islands" title="Shetland Islands" class="mw-redirect">Shetland</a>. The lack of cover on this small island makes skulking passerines easier to find.
The breeding habitat is damp tundra, open forest or marshland. The nest is on the ground, with 4â€“5 eggs being laid. This species is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivore" title="Insectivore">insectivorous</a>, like its relatives.
