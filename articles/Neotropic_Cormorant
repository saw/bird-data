The <b>Neotropic Cormorant</b> or <b>Olivaceous Cormorant</b> (<i>Phalacrocorax brasilianus</i>) is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormorant" title="Cormorant">cormorant</a> found throughout the American tropics and subtropics, from the middle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande" title="Rio Grande">Rio Grande</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_coast" title="Gulf coast" class="mw-redirect">Gulf</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">Californian</a> coasts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">USA</a> south through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> to southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>. It also breeds on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamas" title="Bahamas" class="mw-redirect">Bahamas</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>. It can be found both at coasts (including some mangrove areas) and on inland waters. There are at least two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>: <i>P. b. mexicanus</i> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> northwards and <i>P. b. brasilianus</i> further south.
The species was documented in 1658 by Willem Piso after travels in Brazil. This formed the basis for the description and naming of the species by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Gmelin" title="Johann Friedrich Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> in 1789. Many later authors preferred to use the name <i>Phalacrocorax olivaceus</i> based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt" title="Alexander von Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a>'s 1805 description because the identity of Piso's birds was considered uncertain. Recently, many authorities such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> have begun to use <i>Phalacrocorax brasilianus</i> after M. Ralph Browning argued that Piso's description and paintings do indeed refer to the Neotropic Cormorant.<sup id="cite_ref-Browning_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Browning-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
This bird is 64&nbsp;cm long with a 100&nbsp;cm wingspan. Adults males weigh from 1.1 to 1.5&nbsp;kg, adult females 50 to 100&nbsp;grams less. Birds of the southern populations tend to be bigger than the more northerly birds. It is small and slender, especially compared to the larger, heavier-looking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-crested_Cormorant" title="Double-crested Cormorant">Double-crested Cormorant</a>. It has a long tail and frequently holds its neck in an S-shape. Adult <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">plumage</a> is mainly black, with a yellow-brown throat patch. During breeding, white tufts appear on the sides of the head, there are scattered white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filoplume" title="Filoplume" class="mw-redirect">filoplumes</a> on the side of the head and the neck, and the throat patch develops a white edge. The upper wings are somewhat greyer than the rest of the body. Juveniles are brownish in color.
Its diet consists mainly of small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>, but will also eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadpole" title="Tadpole">tadpoles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a>, and aquatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>. Information about its prey is sparse, but inland birds seem to feed on small, abundant fish in ponds and sheltered inlets, less than 10&nbsp;cm in length, with an individual weight of a gram or two, such as <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poecilia" title="Poecilia" class="mw-redirect">Poecilia</a></i> spp. especially the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfin_molly" title="Sailfin molly">sailfin molly</a> <i>Poecilia latipinna</i>. This cormorant forages for food by diving underwater, propelling itself by its feet. Its dives are brief, between 5 and 15 seconds. It is also known to forage in groups, with several birds beating the water with their wings to drive fish forward into shallows.
Neotropic Cormorants are monogamous and breed in colonies. The nest is a platform of sticks with a depression in the center circled with twigs and grass. It is built a few metres above the ground or water in bushes or trees. Up to five chalky, bluish-white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> are laid. Most pairs lay 3 eggs, but the mean number hatched is less than 2. The eggs soon become nest-stained. Both sexes incubate for about 25â€“30 days, and both parents feed the young until around the 11th week. By week 12, they are independent. One brood is raised per year.
Unlike other cormorants, this bird can often be seen perching on wires.
This bird is largely a permanent resident, with some birds occasionally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">wandering</a> north in the warmer months.
