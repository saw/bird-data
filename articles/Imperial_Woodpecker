The <b>Imperial Woodpecker</b> (<i>Campephilus imperialis</i>) is – or was – a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picidae" title="Picidae" class="mw-redirect">Picidae</a>. If it is not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct" title="Extinct" class="mw-redirect">extinct</a>, it is the world's largest woodpecker species at 56–60&nbsp;cm (22–24&nbsp;in) long.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Due to its close relationship and similarity to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory-billed_Woodpecker" title="Ivory-billed Woodpecker">Ivory-billed Woodpecker</a>, it is sometimes also called "Mexican Ivorybill" but this name is also used for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale-billed_Woodpecker" title="Pale-billed Woodpecker">Pale-billed Woodpecker</a>. The large and conspicuous bird has for long been known to the native inhabitants of Mexico and was called <i><b>cuauhtotomomi</b></i> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuatl" title="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a>, <i><b>uagam</b></i> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepehu%C3%A1n" title="Tepehuán" class="mw-redirect">Tepehuán</a>, and <i><b>cumecócari</b></i> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarahumara" title="Tarahumara" class="mw-redirect">Tarahumara</a>.
The male had a red-sided crest, but was otherwise black, apart from the inner primaries, which were white-tipped, white secondaries, and a white scapular stripe which unlike in the Ivory-billed Woodpecker did not extend on the neck. The female was similar but the crest was all black and (unlike the Ivorybill) recurved at the top. It was once widespread and, until the early 1950s, not uncommon throughout the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_Occidental" title="Sierra Madre Occidental">Sierra Madre Occidental</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, from western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora" title="Sonora">Sonora</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua_(state)" title="Chihuahua (state)">Chihuahua</a> southwards to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalisco" title="Jalisco">Jalisco</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michoac%C3%A1n" title="Michoacán">Michoacán</a>.
It preferred open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montane_forest" title="Montane forest" class="mw-redirect">montane forests</a> made up of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durango_Pine" title="Durango Pine">Durango</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_White_Pine" title="Mexican White Pine">Mexican White</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loblolly_Pine" title="Loblolly Pine" class="mw-redirect">Loblolly</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montezuma_Pine" title="Montezuma Pine" class="mw-redirect">Montezuma Pines</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak" title="Oak">oak</a>, usually between 2100 and 2700 meters <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level" title="Above mean sea level">ASL</a>. It fed mainly by scaling bark from dead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine" title="Pine">pine</a> trees and feeding on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insect</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva" title="Larva">larvae</a> found underneath. A mating pair required a very large area of untouched mature forest to survive, approximately 26&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (10&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi); outside the breeding season, the birds apparently formed small groups of a handful to a dozen individuals and moved about a wider area, apparently in response to availability of food (Lammertink <i>et al.</i>, 1996).
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Lab_of_Ornithology" title="Cornell Lab of Ornithology">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a> has released a film of the woodpecker, recorded in Mexico in 1956.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Imperial Woodpecker is officially listed as <b>Critically Endangered (possibly extinct)</b> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BirdLife_International" title="BirdLife International">BirdLife International</a>. However, the last confirmed report was of one female in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durango_(state)" title="Durango (state)" class="mw-redirect">Durango</a> in 1956 and the species is probably now extinct. The primary reason for its decline was loss of habitat, although the decline was also accelerated by over-hunting for use in folk medicine and because nestlings were considered a delicacy at least by the Tarahumara. Imperial Woodpeckers were stunning birds and as the species became rare many were apparently shot by people who had never encountered such a bird and wanted to get a closer look (Lammertink <i>et al.</i>, 1996).
Given the near total destruction of its original habitat, and the lack of any confirmed sightings in over 50 years, most ornithologists believe the Imperial Woodpecker must be extinct. There are a handful of more recent, unconfirmed sightings (Mendenhall, 2005), the most recent of which closely followed the 2005 publication of the purported rediscovery of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker. Lammertink <i>et al.</i> (1996), after extensively reviewing post-1956 reports, conclude that the species did indeed survive into the 1990s in the central part of its range but also consider a continued survival very unlikely. According to them, the population was always restricted in historic times, although the species was indeed present in maximum density before a catastrophic decline during the 1950s. The lack of good records from that time is apparently based more on lack of research than on actual rarity, but this seems to have changed radically only one decade later.
The Imperial Woodpecker is known from about 160 museum specimens and a single amateur film from 1956 depicting one bird climbing, foraging and flying. The film has been restored and released by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a> (Lammertink <i>et al.</i> 2011).
