The <b>Ruby-crowned Kinglet</b> (<i>Regulus calendula</i>) is a very small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> bird found throughout <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. It is a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinglet" title="Kinglet">kinglet</a> family. The bird has olive-green plumage with two white wing bars and a white eye-ring. Males have a red crown patch, which is usually concealed. The sexes are identical (apart from the crown), and juveniles are similar in plumage to adults. It is one of the smallest songbirds in North America. The Ruby-crowned Kinglet is not closely related to other kinglets, and is put in its own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgenus" title="Subgenus">subgenus</a>, <i>Corthylio</i>. Three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> are currently recognized.
The kinglet is migratory, and its range extends from northwest Canada and Alaska south to Mexico. Its breeding habitat is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce-fir_forests" title="Spruce-fir forests">spruce-fir forests</a> in the northern, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain" title="Mountain">mountainous</a>, United States and Canada. The Ruby-crowned Kinglet builds a cup-shaped <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a>, which may be pensile or placed on a tree branch and is often hidden. It lays up to 12 eggs, and has the largest clutch of any North American passerine for its size. It is mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivorous" title="Insectivorous" class="mw-redirect">insectivorous</a>, but also eats fruits and seeds.
The Ruby-crowned Kinglet is a very small bird, being 9 to 11 centimeters (3.5 to 4.3 in) long, having a wingspan of 16 to 18 centimeters (6.3 to 7.1 in), and weighing 5 to 10 grams (0.2 to 0.4 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-AAB_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AAB-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It has gray-green upperparts and olive-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buff_(color)" title="Buff (color)" class="mw-redirect">buff</a> underparts.<sup id="cite_ref-BirdsOfMaine_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdsOfMaine-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> It has two white wingbars and a broken white eye ring. The wingbar on the greater secondary coverts (closer to the wing-tip) is wider, and is next to a dark band. The kinglet has a relatively plain face and head, although the male has a scarlet-red crown patch, which is usually concealed by the surrounding feathers. The crown patch is rarely orange, yellow, or not present.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_Characteristics_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA_Characteristics-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Females are identical to males (except for the crown). Immature birds are similar to adult females, since young males lack a crown patch.<sup id="cite_ref-BirdsOfMaine_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdsOfMaine-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The kinglet usually moves along branches or through foliage with short hops, and flies with bursts of rapid wing beats. It is constantly active, and is easily recognized by its characteristic wing-flicking. Its flight has been described as "swift, jerky, and erratic".<sup id="cite_ref-Dunne_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunne-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Compared to the related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-crowned_Kinglet" title="Golden-crowned Kinglet">Golden-crowned Kinglet</a>, the Ruby-crowned Kinglet is slightly larger, more elongated,<sup id="cite_ref-Sibley_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sibley-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> and has greener plumage. The bird can be mistaken for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutton%27s_Vireo" title="Hutton's Vireo">Hutton's Vireo</a>, which also displays wing-flicking, though less frequently than the kinglet. It can also be mistaken for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Vireo" title="Dwarf Vireo">Dwarf Vireo</a> in Mexico. However, both of the vireos are larger, have stouter bills and legs, and lack the kinglet's black bar on the wings.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_Characteristics_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA_Characteristics-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Ruby-crowned Kinglet's vocalizations are remarkably loud and complex for its size. Its song can be divided into three main parts: a series of high pitched notes (<i>zee-zee-zee</i> or <i>tee-tee-tee</i>), two to five low trills (<i>turr</i> or <i>tu</i>), and a repeated three note "galloping" phrase (<i>tee-da-leet</i>, <i>tee-da-leet</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-Borror_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Borror-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> However, there is variation in the songs of a given individual, and they often contain only one or two of the three parts. The third part is only sung by male birds; an abbreviated version is heard from the females. Other vocalizations of the Ruby-crowned Kinglet include alarm calls, simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_calls" title="Contact calls" class="mw-redirect">contact calls</a>, and begging calls produced by chicks.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_Voice_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA_Voice-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
The kinglets are a small group of birds sometimes included in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_warbler" title="Old World warbler">Old World warblers</a>, but frequently given family status,<sup id="cite_ref-BB852_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BB852-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> especially as recent research showed that, despite superficial similarities, the crests are taxonomically remote from the warblers.<sup id="cite_ref-Barker_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Barker-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Spicer_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Spicer-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> The names of the family, Regulidae, and its only genus, <i>Regulus</i>, are derived from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>regulus</i>, a diminutive of <i>rex</i>, "a king",<sup id="cite_ref-Chambers_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Chambers-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> and refer to the characteristic orange or yellow crests of adult kinglets. The Ruby-crowned Kinglet was first described in 1766, in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae" title="12th edition of Systema Naturae">12th edition</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus" title="Carl Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>'s <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae" title="Systema Naturae">Systema Naturae</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Its species name means "by the month", and is shared with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendula" title="Calendula">a genus of flower</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
As a result of its larger size, strongly red (rather than orange or yellow) crest and lack of black crown stripes, as well as its distinctive vocalisations, the Ruby-crowned Kinglet is sometimes considered different enough from the Old World kinglets and the other American species, the Golden-crowned Kinglet, to be sometimes assigned to a separate genus, <i>Corthylio</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
Up to five subspecies have been recognized, but "<i>cineraceus</i>", breeding in montane western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, and "<i>arizonensis</i>", breeding in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>, are considered to be clinal variants of the nominate subspecies.

Hybridization with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-crowned_Kinglet" title="Golden-crowned Kinglet">Golden-crowned Kinglet</a> has been reported to have possibly occurred.<sup id="cite_ref-Pyle_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pyle-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
Their breeding habitat is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">coniferous</a> forests across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a> and the western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. They nest in a well-concealed hanging cup suspended from a conifer branch and may lay as many as twelve eggs in a clutch.
The recent counting indicates that the Ruby-crowned Kinglet population is on the rise. This is mainly due to discovery of less disturbed territory farther north. This allows more successful breeding.
These birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to the southern United States and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Some birds are permanent residents in the west.
Ruby-crowned Kinglets forage actively in trees or shrubs, mainly eating small insects and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a>, some berries and tree <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sap" title="Sap" class="mw-redirect">sap</a>. They may hover over a branch while feeding and sometimes fly out to catch insects in flight. The red crest is raised when agitated or in display. Often, they perform a "broken-wing" act to draw predators away from their nest, which they will defend fearlessly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing" title="Mobbing">mobbing</a> the intruder which may be a cat, squirrel, or human.
