The only finch in its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfamily" title="Subfamily" class="mw-redirect">subfamily</a> that undergoes a complete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molt" title="Molt" class="mw-redirect">molt</a>, the American Goldfinch displays <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in its coloration; the male is a vibrant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow" title="Yellow">yellow</a> in the summer and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive" title="Olive">olive</a> color during the winter months, while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays brightly colored <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> during the breeding season to attract a mate.
The American Goldfinch is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granivore" title="Granivore" class="mw-redirect">granivore</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation" title="Adaptation">adapted</a> for the consumption of seedheads, with a conical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">beak</a> to remove the seeds and agile feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding. It is a social bird, and will gather in large flocks while feeding and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrating</a>. It may behave <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)" title="Territory (animal)">territorially</a> during nest construction, but this aggression is short-lived. Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply, beginning in late July, which is relatively late in the year for a finch. This species is generally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a>, and produces one brood each year.
Human activity has generally benefited the American Goldfinch. It is often found in residential areas, attracted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_feeders" title="Bird feeders" class="mw-redirect">bird feeders</a> which increase its survival rate in these areas. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">Deforestation</a> also creates open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadow" title="Meadow">meadow</a> areas which are its preferred <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a>.

The American Goldfinch is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_animal" title="Diurnal animal" class="mw-redirect">diurnal</a> feeder. According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Lab_of_Ornithology" title="Cornell Lab of Ornithology">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a>, the species is one of the strictest vegetarians in the bird world.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_25-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a>. Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)" title="Diet (nutrition)">diet</a> consists of the seeds from a wide variety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant" title="Annual plant">annual</a> plants, often those of weeds grasses and trees, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thistle" title="Thistle">thistle</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teasel" title="Teasel" class="mw-redirect">teasel</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandelion" title="Dandelion" class="mw-redirect">dandelion</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragweed" title="Ragweed">ragweed</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullein" title="Mullein">mullein</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos_(plant)" title="Cosmos (plant)">cosmos</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsify" title="Salsify">goatsbeard</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower" title="Sunflower">sunflower</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder" title="Alder">alder</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_20-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries.

Unlike some finch species, the American Goldfinch uses its feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding in order to reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American Goldfinch feeds on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catkin" title="Catkin">catkins</a> hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch.

The courtship rituals of the American Goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male is able to signal his quality and fitness, both in the short term (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage).<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.<sup id="cite_ref-Hinterlands_14-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hinterlands-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
Once a male has found a mate, he selects a territory, marking the boundaries by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward in a series of loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.<sup id="cite_ref-Hinterlands_14-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hinterlands-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
The nest is built in late summer by the female in the branches of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> shrub or tree at a height of up to 10 meters (33&nbsp;ft). The nest-building lasts approximately six days, during which time the female works in 10–40&nbsp;minute increments. The male frequently flies with the female as she collects nesting materials, and though he may carry some materials back to the nest, he leaves its construction to the female. The outer shell of the nest is built of bark, weeds, vines, and grass.<sup id="cite_ref-Smithsonian_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Smithsonian-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> The inside diameter of the finished nest is about 6.5 centimeters (2.6&nbsp;in).<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_20-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> The rim is reinforced with bark bound by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_web" title="Spider web">spiderwebs</a> and caterpillar silk, and the cup is lined with plant down from milkweed, thistle, or cattail.

American Goldfinches are occasionally victims of brood parasites, particularly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-headed_Cowbird" title="Brown-headed Cowbird">Brown-headed Cowbirds</a>. One study found that 9% of nests had Brown-headed Cowbird eggs in them.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> American Goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of Brown-headed Cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is despite the fact that the American Goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of Brown-headed Cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition" title="Nutrition">nutrition</a>; the seed-rich diet of American Goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup>
The American Goldfinch is found in residential areas throughout its range. Backyard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdwatching" title="Birdwatching">birders</a> attract it using feeders containing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_seed" title="Niger seed" class="mw-redirect">Nyjer thistle seed</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-hearth_26-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hearth-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> or by planting grasses and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_plant" title="Perennial plant">perennial plants</a>, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinnias" title="Zinnias" class="mw-redirect">zinnias</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos_(plant)" title="Cosmos (plant)">cosmos</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_balm" title="Bee balm" class="mw-redirect">bee balm</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe_thistle" title="Globe thistle" class="mw-redirect">globe thistle</a>, which produce seedheads favored by finches. Although some controversy surrounds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_feeding" title="Bird feeding">bird feeding</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_feeder" title="Bird feeder">bird feeder</a> for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species.<sup id="cite_ref-hearth_26-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hearth-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup>
The American Goldfinch is not threatened by human activity, and is widespread throughout its range.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ITIS_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ITIS-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The clearing of forests by humans, though harmful to many species, has benefited the American Goldfinch. Clearing of woodlands causes declines in numbers of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neotropical" title="Neotropical" class="mw-redirect">neotropical</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrants</a>, while favoring short-distance migrants and permanent residents.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> This benefits the American Goldfinch both as a short-distance migrant, and because the created open areas are the preferred environment of the bird, where weeds thrive which produce the primary food source of the American Goldfinch.<sup id="cite_ref-ChipperWoods_15-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ChipperWoods-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
