The <b>Labrador Duck</b> (<i>Camptorhynchus labradorius</i>) was a striking black and white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eider" title="Eider">eider</a>-like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merginae" title="Merginae">sea duck</a> that was never common, and is believed to be the first bird to become extinct in North America after 1500. The last Labrador Duck is believed to have been seen at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmira,_New_York" title="Elmira, New York">Elmira, New York</a> on December 12, 1878; the last preserved specimen was shot in 1875 on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island" title="Long Island">Long Island</a>. It was thought to breed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador" title="Labrador">Labrador</a>, and it wintered from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> to as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay" title="Chesapeake Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>.
The Labrador Duck migrated annually, wintering off the coasts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a>—where it favoured southern sandy coasts, bays, and inlets—and breeding in Labrador in the summer. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Audubon" title="John James Audubon">John James Audubon</a>'s son reported seeing a nest belonging to the species in Labrador, but it is uncertain where it bred. Some believe that it may have laid its eggs in the islands in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Saint_Lawrence" title="Gulf of Saint Lawrence">Gulf of Saint Lawrence</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-gap_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gap-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Labrador Duck was also known as a Pied Duck, a vernacular name that it shared with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Scoter" title="Surf Scoter">Surf Scoter</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Goldeneye" title="Common Goldeneye">Common Goldeneye</a> (and even the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Oystercatcher" title="American Oystercatcher">American Oystercatcher</a>), a fact that has led to difficulties in interpreting old records of these species, and also as Skunk Duck. Both names refer to the male's striking white/black piebald coloration. Yet another common name was Sand Shoal Duck, referring to its habit of feeding in shallow water. The closest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolutionary</a> relatives of the Labrador Duck are apparently the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoter" title="Scoter">scoters</a> (<i>Melanitta</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Labrador Duck fed on small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusca" title="Mollusca">molluscs</a>, and some fishermen reported catching it on fishing lines baited with mussels.<sup id="cite_ref-gap_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gap-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The structure of the bill was highly modified from that of most ducks, having a wide, flattened tip with numerous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamellae_(zoology)" title="Lamellae (zoology)" class="mw-redirect">lamellae</a> inside. In this way it is considered an ecological counterpart of the North <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a>/North <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asian</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steller%27s_Eider" title="Steller's Eider">Steller's Eider</a>. The beak was also particularly soft, and may have been used to probe through sediment for food.<sup id="cite_ref-gap_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gap-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
Another, completely unrelated, duck with similar (but even more specialized) bill morphology is the Australian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink-eared_Duck" title="Pink-eared Duck">Pink-eared Duck</a>, which feeds largely on plankton, but also mollusks; the condition in the Labrador Duck probably resembled that in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Duck" title="Blue Duck">Blue Duck</a> most in outward appearance.
It is thought that the Labrador Duck was always rare, but between 1850 and 1870, populations waned further.<sup id="cite_ref-gap_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gap-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Its extinction is still not fully explained. Although hunted for food, this duck was considered to taste bad, would rot quickly and fetched a low price. Consequently, it was not sought much by hunters. However, it is thought that the eggs may have been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overexploitation" title="Overexploitation">over-harvested</a>, and it may have been subject to depredations by the feather trade in its breeding area as well. Another possible factor in the bird's extinction was the decline in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussel" title="Mussel">mussels</a> and other shellfish on which they are believed to have fed in their winter quarters, due to growth of population and industry on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="East Coast of the United States">Eastern Seaboard</a>. Although all sea ducks readily feed on shallow-water molluscs, no Western Atlantic bird species seems to have been as dependent on such food as much as the Labrador Duck.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
