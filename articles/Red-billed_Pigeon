It belongs to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade" title="Clade">clade</a> of <i>Patagioenas</i> which generally lack iridescent display plumage, except some vestiges in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale-vented_Pigeon" title="Pale-vented Pigeon">Pale-vented Pigeon</a>.
It is found in open country with some trees, large clearings and cultivation in lowlands and middle altitudes to 2100 meters. It builds a rudimentary platform nest out of twigs in a tree about 4–25 metres (13–82 ft) above the ground, usually on a horizontal branch or on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecaceae" title="Arecaceae">palm</a> crown, and lays one white egg.
The Red-billed Pigeon is mid or large-sized pigeon, at 30–37 cm (12–15 in) in length and a weight of 230–425 g (8.1–15.0 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It is mainly wine-purple, becoming browner on the back, and with a grey tail, lower belly and flight feathers. The bill is white with a red base, and the legs and eyes are red. Juvenile birds are duller than adults and the plumage is brown-tinged.
It is normally seen alone or in pairs and rarely forms flocks. It feeds on the ground, seeking acorns, berries and buds.
The Red-billed Pigeon has a loud <i>kuk c'c'coooo</i> call that is given in rows; the initial short <i>kuk</i> is characteristic for this group of <i>Patagioenas</i> (Mahler &amp; Tubaro 2001).
