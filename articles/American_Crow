The <b>American Crow</b> (<i>Corvus brachyrhynchos</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> bird <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvidae" title="Corvidae">Corvidae</a>. It is a common bird found throughout much of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. In the interior of the continent south of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a>, it is referred to as simply "the crow."
It is one of several species of corvid that are entirely black, though it can be distinguished from the other two such birds in its range—from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Raven" title="Common Raven">Common Raven</a> (<i>C. corax</i>) by size and behavior and from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_Crow" title="Fish Crow">Fish Crow</a> (<i>C. ossifragus</i>) by call (but see <a href="#Description">below</a>). It is also distinguished from the Raven by its smaller, more curved bill than the parallel bill of the raven, and its squared tail.
American Crows are common, widespread and adaptable, but they are highly susceptible to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Nile_Virus" title="West Nile Virus" class="mw-redirect">West Nile Virus</a>. They are monitored as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioindicator" title="Bioindicator">bioindicator</a>. Direct transmission of the virus from American Crows to humans is not recorded to date, and in any case not considered likely.
Although the American crow and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooded_crow" title="Hooded crow" class="mw-redirect">Hooded crow</a> are very similar in size, structure and behavior, their calls are different. The American crow nevertheless occupies the same role the hooded crow does in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>.
The American Crow was described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Ludwig_Brehm" title="Christian Ludwig Brehm">Christian Ludwig Brehm</a> in 1822.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_name" title="Scientific name" class="mw-redirect">scientific name</a> means literally "short-billed crow", from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> <i>brachy-</i> (βραχυ-) "short-" and <i>rhynchos</i> (ρυνχος) "billed".<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Crow" title="Northwestern Crow">Northwestern Crow</a> (<i>C. caurinus</i>) is very closely related to the American Crow. Its ancestors became separated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Age" title="Ice Age" class="mw-redirect">Ice Age</a> glaciation west of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>.

There is a marked difference in voice.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Four subspecies are recognized. They differ in bill proportion and form a rough NE-SW <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(population_genetics)" title="Cline (population genetics)" class="mw-redirect">clinal</a> in size across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>.

The American Crow is a distinctive bird with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence" title="Iridescence">iridescent</a> black feathers all over. Its legs, feet and bill are also black. They measure 40–53 cm (16–21 in) in length, of which the tail makes up about 40%. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 24.5 to 33 cm (9.6 to 13 in), with the wingspan ranging from 85 to 100 cm (33 to 39 in). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> length can be from 3 to 5.5 cm (1.2 to 2.2 in), varying strongly according to location. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 5.5 to 6.5 cm (2.2 to 2.6 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail" title="Tail">tail</a> is 13.5 to 19 cm (5.3 to 7.5 in).<sup id="cite_ref-m.26b1994_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-m.26b1994-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The body mass can vary from 316 to 620 g (11.1 to 22 oz).

The most usual call is a loud, short, and rapid <i>caaw-caaw-caaw</i>. Usually, the birds thrust their heads up and down as they utter this call. American Crows can also produce a wide variety of sounds and sometimes mimic noises made by other animals, including other birds.
Visual differentiation from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_Crow" title="Fish Crow">Fish Crow</a> (<i>C. ossifragus</i>) is extremely difficult and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish Crows tend to have more slender bills and feet. There may also be a small sharp hook at the end of the upper bill. Fish Crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, Fish Crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.
If seen flying at a distance from where size estimates are unreliable, the distinctly larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Raven" title="Common Raven">Common Ravens</a> (<i>C. corax</i>) can be distinguished by their almost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge" title="Lozenge">lozenge</a>-shaped tail, their larger-looking heads and of course their strongly solitary habits. They also fluff their throat feathers when calling like Fish Crows, only more so.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Most wild American Crows live for about 7–8 years. Captive birds are known to have lived up to 30 years.<sup id="cite_ref-cdep2001_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cdep2001-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>

This crow is a permanent resident in most of the USA, but most Canadian birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> some distances southward in winter. Outside of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesting_season" title="Nesting season">nesting season</a> these birds often gather in large (thousands or even millions<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>) communal roosts at night.
The American Crow was recorded in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_and_fauna_in_Bermuda" title="Flora and fauna in Bermuda" class="mw-redirect">Bermuda</a> from 1876 onwards.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>

American Crows are active hunters and will prey on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse" title="Mouse">mice</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a>, and other small animals. In winter and autumn, the diet of American Crows is more dependent on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(fruit)" title="Nut (fruit)">nuts</a> and acorns. Occasionally, they will visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_feeder" title="Bird feeder">bird feeders</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-parr2005_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-parr2005-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The American Crow is one of only a few species of bird that has been observed modifying and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_use_by_animals" title="Tool use by animals">using tools</a> to obtain food.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
Like most crows, they will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger" title="Scavenger">scavenge</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill" title="Landfill">landfills</a>, scattering garbage in the process.

The nesting season starts early, with some birds incubating eggs by early April.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> American Crows build bulky stick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nests</a>, nearly always in trees but sometimes also in large bushes and, very rarely, on the ground. They will nest in a wide variety of trees, including large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">conifers</a>, although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak" title="Oak">oaks</a> are most often used. Three to six eggs are laid and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubate_(bird)" title="Incubate (bird)" class="mw-redirect">incubated</a> for 18 days.
