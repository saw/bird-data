<i>Dendroica graciae</i> <small>Baird, 1865</small>
<b>Grace's Warbler</b> (<i>Setophaga graciae</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_warbler" title="New World warbler">New World warbler</a> that specializes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine" title="Pine">pine</a> woods.
Grace's Warbler was discovered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Coues" title="Elliott Coues">Elliott Coues</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> in 1864. He requested that the new species be named after his 18-year-old sister, Grace Darling Coues, and his request was honored when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Fullerton_Baird" title="Spencer Fullerton Baird">Spencer Fullerton Baird</a> described the species scientifically in 1865.
Grace's Warbler is a small bird, 11â€“13&nbsp;cm long. It is mostly gray on top, with broken black streaks across the back and flanks and two white bars on the wings. The throat and breast are a vibrant yellow, and the rest of the underparts are white. It has a yellow half-eye ring under the eye and a long yellow "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercilium" title="Supercilium">eyebrow</a>" stripe that starts at the base of the beak and runs above the eye, fading to white after it passes the eye.
Grace's Warblers breed from the southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> and winter in their breeding range from northeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinaloa" title="Sinaloa">Sinaloa</a> and northwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durango" title="Durango">Durango</a> south. They are almost always found in pine forests, even in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migration</a>, though at the northern end of their range (in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a> and southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>) they occur in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce" title="Spruce">spruce</a>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir" title="Fir">fir</a> forest. They prefer open, "parklike" woods, and in some areas such as northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> they prefer an understory of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Gambel%27s_Oak&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Gambel's Oak (page does not exist)">Gambel's Oak</a>. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S." title="U.S." class="mw-redirect">U.S.</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> they typically occur at altitudes of 1,800 to 2,700 metres (5,900 to 8,900 ft)); farther south they may occur as low as 250&nbsp;m. They are common in some localities, and in areas of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquitia" title="Mosquitia" class="mw-redirect">Mosquitia</a> of Nicaragua where the only tree is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Pine" title="Caribbean Pine">Caribbean Pine</a>, Grace's Warblers may be the only bird seen.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The nesting habits of Grace's Warblers are largely unknown, as nests are very rarely found. The nest is a compact cup of plant fibers, the inside lined with hair and feathers, placed high above ground on a tree branch, usually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine" title="Pine">pine</a>. The female lays 3 to 5white or cream-colored eggs, speckled with brown, and ringed at the larger end.
Like the vast majority of warblers, Grace's Warbler eats only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a>, as far as is known from limited studies. It forages mostly high in pine trees (86% of its foraging time in a study in Arizona was in pines, but it foraged in oaks more in Mexico where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Warbler" title="Olive Warbler">Olive Warblers</a> also occur). It catches its food from the bases of needle clusters and the upper bark of branches no thicker than its body.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> It will often hover to inspect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer_cone" title="Conifer cone">pine cones</a> for insect larvae.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from March 2012">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In Arizona it seldom flies to catch insects, but in Nicaragua it often does.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
