<i>Hylocichla swainsonii</i>
<b>Swainson's Thrush</b> (<i>Catharus ustulatus</i>), also called <b>Olive-backed Thrush</b>, is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_(bird)" title="Thrush (bird)">thrush</a>. It is a member of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharus" title="Catharus">Catharus</a></i> genus and is typical of it in terms of its subdued coloration and beautiful voice. Swainson's Thrush was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_John_Swainson" title="William John Swainson">William Swainson</a>, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">English</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithologist" title="Ornithologist" class="mw-redirect">ornithologist</a>.
The breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a> of Swainson's Thrush is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">coniferous</a> woods with dense undergrowth across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> and the northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> wooded areas on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Pacific</a> coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>.
These birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>. The coastal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> migrate down the Pacific coast of North America and winter from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>, whereas the continental birds migrate eastwards within North America (a substantial detour) and then travel southwards via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> to winter from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>. Swainson's Thrush is a very rare vagrant to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. It has also occurred as a vagrant in northeast Asia.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species may be displaced by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit_Thrush" title="Hermit Thrush">Hermit Thrush</a> where their ranges overlap. Possibly, the latter species adapts more readily to human encroachment upon its habitat. At least in the winter quarters, Swainson's Thrush tends to keep away from areas of human construction and other activity.
This species is 16–20 cm (6.3–7.9 in) in length. The wingspan averages at 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) and the wing chord is 8.7–10.5 cm (3.4–4.1 in). The bill measures 1.5–1.9 cm (0.59–0.75 in) in length and the tarsus is 2.5 to 3.1 cm (0.98 to 1.2 in) long. This species' body mass can range from 23 to 45 g (0.81 to 1.6 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> This thrush has the white-dark-white underwing pattern characteristic of <i>Catharus</i> thrushes. Adults are brown on the upperparts. The underparts are white with brown on the flanks; the breast is lighter brown with darker spots. They have pink legs and a light brown eye ring. Birds in the east are more olive-brown on the upperparts; western birds are more reddish-brown. This bird's song is a hurried series of flute-like tones spiralling upwards.
They forage on the forest floor, also in trees. Swainson's Thrushes mainly eat insects, fruits and berries.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> They make a cup nest on a horizontal tree branch.
Four subspecies are recognised, <i>Cathartus ustulatus alame</i>, <i>C. u. swainsoni</i>, <i>C. u. ustulatus</i> and <i>C. u. oedicus</i>. Subspecies <i>Cathartus ustulatus alame</i> and <i>C. u. swainsoni</i> summer east of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbian</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_Mountains" title="Coast Mountains">Coast Mountains</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range" title="Cascade Range">Cascades</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" title="Sierra Nevada (U.S.)">Sierra Nevada</a>, and <i>C. u. ustulatus</i> and <i>C. u. oedicus</i> summer west of these ranges. There is a small area of overlap in the Coast Mountains. Recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_systematics" title="Molecular systematics" class="mw-redirect">molecular systematics</a> work<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> confirms that these two pairs of subspecies form two genetically distinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade" title="Clade">clades</a>, referred to as the continental and coastal clades, which diverged during the Late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene" title="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> era, probably about 10,000 years ago as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_ice_age" title="Last ice age" class="mw-redirect">last ice age</a> came to its end and habitats shifted across North America.
The genetic differences between the subspecies, and the circuitous migratory route of the continental birds, strongly suggest that these species underwent a rapid range expansion following the end of the last <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age" title="Ice age">ice age</a>, with populations originally summering in the south-east of North America expanding their ranges northwards and westwards as the ice retreated. Details of the molecular genetic analysis support the hypothesis of rapid expansion of both coastal and continental populations. The current migratory routes of the continental birds, especially the western populations, are not optimal in ecological terms, and presumably represent an inherited, historical route pattern that has not yet adapted to the birds' modern population locations.
These results notwithstanding, analysis of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MtDNA" title="MtDNA" class="mw-redirect">mtDNA</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_b" title="Cytochrome b">cytochrome <i>b</i></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NADH_dehydrogenase" title="NADH dehydrogenase">NADH dehydrogenase</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit" title="Protein subunit">subunit</a> 2 as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_DNA" title="Nuclear DNA">nuclear</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen" title="Fibrinogen">β-fibrinogen</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron" title="Intron">intron</a> 7 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequence" title="DNA sequence" class="mw-redirect">sequence</a> data<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> shows that Swainson's Thrush is the most ancient North American species of its genus; it is not closely related to other <i>Catharus</i> and the outward similarities with the other North American species are due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution" title="Convergent evolution">convergent evolution</a>.
