This species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling" title="Starling">starling</a> is native to most of temperate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. It is resident in southern and western Europe and southwestern Asia, while northeastern populations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> south and west in winter to these regions, and also further south to areas where it does not breed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_peninsula" title="Iberian peninsula" class="mw-redirect">Iberia</a> and north <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>.

Along with <i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>, the <i>Sturnus</i> genus includes a number of species which are apparently more-or-less distantly related, but some contend that if the taxonomy is to be based on natural evolutionary grouping, then only the European and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotless_Starling" title="Spotless Starling">Spotless Starling</a> ought to be grouped together.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
There are several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> of the European Starling, which vary in the iridescence of adult plumage. With gradual variation over geographic range and extensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergradation" title="Intergradation">intergradation</a>, the subspecies are said to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(biology)" title="Cline (biology)">clinal</a>.

It is among the most familiar of birds in temperate regions. It is 19–23 cm (7.5–9.1 in) long, with a wingspan of 31–44 cm (12–17 in) and a weight of 58–101 g (2.0–3.6 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 11.8 to 13.8 cm (4.6 to 5.4 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail" title="Tail">tail</a> is 5.8 to 6.8 cm (2.3 to 2.7 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmen_(bird)" title="Culmen (bird)" class="mw-redirect">culmen</a> is 2.5 to 3.2 cm (0.98 to 1.3 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 2.7 to 3.2 cm (1.1 to 1.3 in).<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> is shiny black, glossed purple or green, and spangled with white, particularly strongly so in winter. Adult male European Starlings are less spotted below than adult females. The throat feathers are long and loose, and used as a signal in display. Juveniles are grey-brown, and by their first winter resemble adults though often retain some brown juvenile feathering especially on the head in the early part of the winter. The legs are stout, pinkish-red. The bill is narrow conical with a sharp tip; in summer, it is yellow in females, and yellow with a blue-grey base in males, while in winter and in juveniles, it is black in both sexes. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moult" title="Moult" class="mw-redirect">Moulting</a> occurs once a year, in late summer after the breeding season is finished; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white (breast feathers) or buff (wing and back feathers). The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved by the white feather tips largely wearing off. Starlings walk rather than hop. Their flight is quite strong and direct; they look triangular-winged and short-tailed in flight.<sup id="cite_ref-bwpc_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bwpc-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-svensson_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-svensson-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Confusion with other species is only likely in Iberia, the western Mediterranean and northwest Africa in winter, when it has to be distinguished from the closely related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotless_Starling" title="Spotless Starling">Spotless Starling</a>, which, as its name implies, has less spotting on its plumage. The Spotless Starling can also be diagnostically distinguished at close range by its longer throat feathers.<sup id="cite_ref-svensson_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-svensson-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> At a more basic level, adult male <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Blackbird" title="European Blackbird" class="mw-redirect">European Blackbirds</a> can easily be distinguished by more slender body shape, longer tail, and behaviour; they hop instead of walking and do not probe for food with open bills. In flight, only the much paler <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxwing" title="Waxwing">waxwings</a> share a similar flight profile.
The Common Starling is a noisy bird uttering a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding sounds, including a distinctive "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf-whistling" title="Wolf-whistling">wolf-whistle</a>". Starlings are mimics, like many of its family. In captivity, Starlings will learn to imitate all types of sounds and speech earning them the nickname "poor-man's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myna" title="Myna">Myna</a>".
Songs are more commonly sung by males, although females also sing. Songs consist of a mixture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry" title="Mimicry">mimicry</a>, clicks, wheezes, chattering, whistles, rattles, and piping notes.<sup id="cite_ref-H1924_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H1924-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Besides song, 11 other calls have been described, including a Flock Call, Threat Call, Attack Call, Snarl Call, and Copulation Call.<sup id="cite_ref-H1924_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H1924-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Birds chatter while roosting and bathing—making a great deal of noise that can frustrate local human inhabitants. Even when a flock of starlings is completely silent, the synchronized movements of the flock make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres away.<sup id="cite_ref-H1924_11-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H1924-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
Common Starlings prefer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area" title="Urban area">urban</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburban" title="Suburban" class="mw-redirect">suburban</a> areas where artificial structures and trees provide adequate nesting and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosting" title="Roosting" class="mw-redirect">roosting</a> sites. They also commonly reside in grassy areas where foraging is easy—such as farmland, grazing pastures, playing fields, golf courses, and airfields.<sup id="cite_ref-H1907_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H1907-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> They occasionally inhabit open forests and woodlands and more rarely in shrublands such as the Australian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathland" title="Heathland" class="mw-redirect">heathland</a>. European Starlings rarely inhabit dense, wet forests (i.e. rainforests or wet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerophyll" title="Sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forests). Common starlings have also adapted to coastal areas, where they nest and roost on cliffs and forage amongst seaweed. Their ability to adapt to a large variety of habitats has allowed for their dispersal and establishment throughout the world—resulting in a habitat range from coastal wetlands to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_climate" title="Alpine climate">alpine</a> forests, from sea level to 1900 metres above sea level.<sup id="cite_ref-H1907_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H1907-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>

Very large roosts, exceptionally up to 1.5 million birds, can form in city centres, woodlands, or reedbeds, causing problems with their droppings.

Earlier, the European Starling had shown marked increases throughout Europe in the period 1800-1900. Before 1800, it had a disjunct range in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, absent from central and southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, with <i>S. vulgaris zetlandicus</i> in the far north and northwest (Shetland, Orkney, Caithness, Outer Hebrides), and <i>S. vulgaris vulgaris</i> south of the Scottish-English border; it was also rare or regionally absent in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a> and western and northernmost England. Between 1800 and 1900, <i>S. vulgaris vulgaris</i> colonised north and westward from England to Ireland and all of Scotland except for Shetland (where <i>zetlandicus</i> remains present); since 1935, this subspecies has also spread to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, where it now breeds in the southeast and southwest.<sup id="cite_ref-bwpc_4-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bwpc-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-holloway_34-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-holloway-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>S. vulgaris vulgaris</i> is also occasionally seen in the Faroes.
This adaptable species is considered to be a pest in several of the countries to which it has been introduced. Unlike other widely introduced species such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Sparrow" title="House Sparrow">House Sparrows</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Pigeon" title="Rock Pigeon" class="mw-redirect">Rock Pigeons</a>, starlings easily adapt in areas outside of cities and towns and can thrive in a variety of protected habitats where they are not native. The European Starling is a hole-nesting species and will nest in just about any cavity it finds. It has affected native species where it has been introduced because it fiercely competes for nest sites. For example, in North America, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Martin" title="Purple Martin">Purple Martin</a> is now widely dependent on artificial nest houses put up by humans, which must be protected from colonization by European Starlings.
The Common Starling was originally introduced to Australia in order to decrease the population of crop pests—insects which the starlings were known to eat. Early settlers looked forward to the bird’s arrival, believing that starlings were also important to the pollination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flax" title="Flax">flax</a>, an important crop. Nest-boxes for the newly released species were placed on farms and near crops.<sup id="cite_ref-H19112_35-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H19112-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> The Common Starling was introduced to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in 1857 then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> in 1880.<sup id="cite_ref-H1910_36-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H1910-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> By the 1880s, established populations were present in the southeast, thanks to the work of acclimatization committees.<sup id="cite_ref-Wooly_37-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wooly-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> By the 1920s, starlings were widespread through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland" title="Queensland">Queensland</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a>, but they were now recognized as pests and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" title="Western Australia">Western Australia</a> banned their import in 1895.<sup id="cite_ref-H1910_36-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H1910-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Wooly_37-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wooly-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Common Starling threatens both Australian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy" title="Economy">economy</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. They commonly eat and damage fruit from orchards, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape" title="Grape">grapes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach" title="Peach">peaches</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive" title="Olive">olives</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribes" title="Ribes">currants</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato" title="Tomato">tomatoes</a>. In addition, starlings dig up newly sown grain and diminish already growing crops—an easy task for a flock of 500 – 150,000 birds.<sup id="cite_ref-pestnote_25-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pestnote-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> The Common Starling will also eat and foul food meant for livestock, putting the health of livestock at stake. The accumulation of waste left behind by large flocks may ruin human water supplies and cities, as well as natural habitats for Australian fauna.<sup id="cite_ref-pestnote_25-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pestnote-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup>
Australia is home to numerous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism" title="Endemism">endemic</a> plants and animals — species that live nowhere else on earth. The Common Starling is an aggressive bird that displaces other hollow nesting, endemic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_birds" title="Australian birds" class="mw-redirect">Australian birds</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Pell_38-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pell-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> With so many of these native species already endangered, the starling poses a significant threat. They also pose a risk to the native and endemic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_flora" title="Australian flora" class="mw-redirect">Australian flora</a>. Seeds will often germinate more successfully after ingestion, and, as they are capable of eating almost any kind of seed and flying great distances, Common Starlings are excellent weed dispersers. They are responsible for spreading invasive plant species such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridal_Creeper" title="Bridal Creeper" class="mw-redirect">Bridal Creeper</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-WWF_39-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WWF-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup>
As a result, the government of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" title="Western Australia">Western Australia</a> has gone to great lengths to keep the Common Starling on the other side of their borders. In the state's 2007-2008 budget, an additional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A$" title="A$" class="mw-redirect">A$</a>4.9 million (2007) was allocated to the control and eradication program.<sup id="cite_ref-WWF_39-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WWF-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> New flocks are routinely shot down, while the less cautious juveniles are trapped and netted.<sup id="cite_ref-Wooly_37-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wooly-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> New methods are currently being developed, the first of which tags one bird and follows it back to the rest of the flock, exposing a new population for termination.<sup id="cite_ref-Judas_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Judas-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> The second analyzes the DNA of Australian Common Starling populations to track where the migration from eastern to western Australia is occurring so that better preventative strategies can be used.<sup id="cite_ref-Rollins_42-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rollins-42"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup>

In 1889 and 1892, the Portland Song Bird Club released 35 pairs of starlings in Portland, Oregon. These birds established themselves, but then disappeared in 1901 or 1902. The next sighting of a starling in the Pacific Northwest was not until the mid 1940s. Presumably these birds could be genetically linked to the 1890 Central Park introduction.<sup id="cite_ref-wdfw.wa.gov_43-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wdfw.wa.gov-43"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup>
It is difficult to reach a consensus on starlings. Some value the species for their creative adaptiveness and their odd beauty. Many hold a strong dislike of starlings because of their aggressive behavior at feeders and nesting sites, and their overwhelming flocks and roosting habits. There is only one thing on which agreement can be reached regarding starlings—they are ubiquitous.<sup id="cite_ref-wdfw.wa.gov_43-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wdfw.wa.gov-43"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup>
