The <b>Carolina Parakeet</b> (<i>Conuropsis carolinensis</i>)<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>Note 1<span>]</span></a></sup> was the only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot" title="Parrot">parrot</a> species native to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_United_States" title="Eastern United States">eastern United States</a>. It was found from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, and lived in old forests along rivers.<sup id="cite_ref-Griggs_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Griggs-3"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It is the only species classified in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><b>Conuropsis</b></i>. It was called <i><b>puzzi la née</b></i> ("head of yellow") or <i><b>pot pot chee</b></i> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole" title="Seminole">Seminole</a> and <i><b>kelinky</b></i> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickasaw_language" title="Chickasaw language">Chickasaw</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Snyder_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Snyder-4"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Carolina Parakeet's habitats were forests along rivers, with large hollow trees to use as roosting and nesting sites. It mostly ate the seeds of forest shrubs and other plants (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thistle" title="Thistle">thistles</a>) and also ate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a> (often from orchards by the time of its decline).<sup id="cite_ref-Griggs_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Griggs-3"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Carolina Parakeets were probably poisonous—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Audubon" title="John James Audubon">John James Audubon</a> noted that cats apparently died from eating them, and they are known to have eaten the toxic seeds of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocklebur" title="Cocklebur">cockleburs</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
According to a study of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA" title="Mitochondrial DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> recovered from museum specimens, their closest living relatives include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Parakeet" title="Sun Parakeet">Sun Parakeet</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-capped_Parakeet" title="Golden-capped Parakeet">Golden-capped Parakeet</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanday_Parakeet" title="Nanday Parakeet">Nanday Parakeet</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
The last known wild specimen was killed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okeechobee_County,_Florida" title="Okeechobee County, Florida">Okeechobee County, Florida</a>, in 1904, and the last captive bird died at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Zoo_and_Botanical_Garden" title="Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden">Cincinnati Zoo</a> on February 21, 1918. This was the male specimen "Incas," who died within a year of his mate "Lady Jane." Coincidentally, Incas died in the same aviary cage in which the last <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_Pigeon" title="Passenger Pigeon">Passenger Pigeon</a>, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_(passenger_pigeon)" title="Martha (passenger pigeon)">Martha</a>," had died nearly four years prior.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> It was not until 1939, however, that it was determined that the Carolina Parakeet had become extinct. Some theorists at this time, though, believed a few may have been smuggled out of the country in mid 1900 and may have repopulated elsewhere, although the odds of this are extremely low.
At some date between 1937 and 1955, three parakeets resembling this species were sighted and filmed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okefenokee_Swamp" title="Okefenokee Swamp">Okefenokee Swamp</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a>. However, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> analyzed the film and concluded that they had probably filmed feral parakeets. Additional reports of the bird were made in Okeechobee County, Florida, until the late 1920s, but these are not supported by specimens.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from August 2010">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
The species may have appeared as a very rare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrancy_(biology)" title="Vagrancy (biology)">vagrant</a> in places as far north as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ontario" title="Southern Ontario">Southern Ontario</a>. A few bones, including a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygostyle" title="Pygostyle">pygostyle</a> found at the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Calvert_Site&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Calvert Site (page does not exist)">Calvert Site</a> in Southern Ontario, came from the Carolina Parakeet. The possibility remains open that this specimen was taken to Southern Ontario for ceremonial purposes.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Carolina Parakeet is believed to have died out because of a number of different threats. To make space for more agricultural land, large areas of forest were cut down, taking away its habitat. The bird's colorful feathers (green body, yellow head, and red around the bill) were in demand as decorations in ladies' hats. The birds were also kept as pets and could be bred easily in captivity. However, little was done by owners to increase the population of tamed birds. Finally, they were killed in large numbers because farmers considered them a pest, although many farmers valued them for controlling invasive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocklebur" title="Cocklebur">cockleburs</a>. It has also been hypothesized that the introduced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeybee" title="Honeybee" class="mw-redirect">honeybee</a> helped contribute to its extinction by taking many of the bird's nesting sites.<sup id="cite_ref-EllisNTB_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-EllisNTB-10"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
A factor that contributed to their extinction was the unfortunate flocking behavior that led them to return <i>immediately</i> to a location where some of the birds had just been killed. This led to even more being shot by hunters as they gathered about the wounded and dead members of the flock.
This combination of factors <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction" title="Local extinction">extirpated</a> the species from most of its range until the early years of the 20th century. However, the last populations were not much hunted for food or feathers, nor did the farmers in rural <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> consider them a pest, as the benefit of the birds' love of cockleburs clearly outweighed the minor damage they did to the small-scale garden plots. The final extinction of the species is somewhat of a mystery, but the most likely cause seems to be that the birds succumbed to poultry disease, as suggested by the rapid disappearance of the last, small, but apparently healthy and reproducing flocks of these highly social birds. If this is true, the very fact that the Carolina Parakeet was finally tolerated to roam in the vicinity of human settlements proved its undoing.<sup id="cite_ref-Snyder_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Snyder-4"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The fact remains, however, that persecution significantly reduced the bird's population over many decades.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> subspecies of the Carolina Parakeet, <i>C. c. ludovicianus</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>Note 2<span>]</span></a></sup> was slightly different in color to the parent species, being more bluish-green and generally of a somewhat subdued coloration, and went extinct in much the same way, but at a somewhat earlier date (early 1910s). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains" title="Appalachian Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> separated these birds from the eastern <i>C. c. carolinensis</i>
About 720 skins and 16 skeletons are housed in museums around the world.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1977, ecologist Daniel McKinley accepted 20 of the 49 supposed egg specimens as certainly and 7 as probably correctly assigned to this species.<sup id="cite_ref-McKinley_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-McKinley-13"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Five eggs collected in Florida on April 30, 1927, were controversially attributed to this species (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._T._Wentworth,_Jr._Florida_State_Museum" title="T. T. Wentworth, Jr. Florida State Museum">FSM</a> 87234 - 3 eggs - and 89434 - 2 eggs). These are not accepted as valid by McKinley based on their small size and early date of collection, but molecular analysis could possibly determine whether these are in fact eggs of Carolina Parakeets.<sup id="cite_ref-McKinley_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-McKinley-13"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
A fossil parrot, <i>Conuropsis fratercula</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>Note 3<span>]</span></a></sup> was described based on a single <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus" title="Humerus">humerus</a> from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene" title="Miocene">Miocene</a> <a href="/w/index.php?title=Sheep_Creek_Formation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sheep Creek Formation (page does not exist)">Sheep Creek Formation</a> (possibly late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemingfordian" title="Hemingfordian" class="mw-redirect">Hemingfordian</a>, c.16 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mya_(unit)" title="Mya (unit)" class="mw-redirect">mya</a>, possibly later) of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Snake_Creek,_Nebraska&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Snake Creek, Nebraska (page does not exist)">Snake Creek, Nebraska</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Wetmore_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wetmore-15"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> However, it is not altogether certain that this species is correctly assigned to <i>Conuropsis</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> but some authors<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> consider it a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleosubspecies" title="Paleosubspecies" class="mw-redirect">paleosubspecies</a> of the Carolina Parakeet. This is almost certainly erroneous given the long distance in time, and probably based on a misunderstanding of the original description. Therein, <i>C. fratercula</i> is called a "new subspecies" but <i>fratercula</i> is consistently applied as a species-level name throughout the publication, and the fossil is correctly referenced thus in the discussion:
"The present <i>species</i> is of peculiar interest as it represents the first known parrotlike bird to be described as a fossil from North America."(Wetmore 1926;<sup id="cite_ref-Wetmore_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wetmore-15"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> italics added)
The extinction of the Carolina Parakeet represents the irrevocable loss of eastern North America's only truly indigenous parrot. However, populations of a South American parrot species, <i>Myiopsitta monachus</i>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_Parakeet" title="Monk Parakeet">Monk Parakeet</a>, or Quaker Parrot, began to breed in the same region from the 1960s onwards. Whether introduced accidentally or intentionally, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_Parakeet" title="Monk Parakeet">Monk Parakeet</a> has as of 2009 established flocks in several states, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati" title="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> area), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> (Northern/Greater Cincinnati area), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>.
Smaller feral colonies of several other species of parrots and parakeets have since established themselves in various locations of the USA, including downtown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California" title="Pasadena, California">Pasadena, California</a>; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Parrots_of_Telegraph_Hill" title="The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill">San Francisco, California</a>; and Chicago's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_Chicago" title="Hyde Park, Chicago">Hyde Park</a> neighborhood. Large flocks are well noted in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego" title="San Diego">San Diego</a> region, particularly in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Cajon,_California" title="El Cajon, California">El Cajon</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Beach,_San_Diego,_California" title="Ocean Beach, San Diego, California" class="mw-redirect">Ocean Beach</a> area.
