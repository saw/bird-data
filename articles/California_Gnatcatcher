The <b>California Gnatcatcher</b> (<i>Polioptila californica</i>) is a small 10.8&nbsp;cm (4.25&nbsp;inches) long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivorous" title="Insectivorous" class="mw-redirect">insectivorous</a> bird which frequents dense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_sage_scrub" title="Coastal sage scrub">coastal sage scrub</a> growth. This species was recently split from the similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-tailed_Gnatcatcher" title="Black-tailed Gnatcatcher">Black-tailed Gnatcatcher</a> of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts. This bird is often solitary, but joins with other birds in winter flocks.
The male California Gnatcatcher is dusky gray overall, distinguished only by its black crown and thin black beak. It has a long, thin black tail with narrow white tips and edges on the underside of the tail feathers. However, the male loses its plumage colors by winter, and obtains a plumage color like the females. The female is similar to the male, but with a blue-gray instead of a black crown.
In its range from coastal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California" title="Southern California">Southern California</a> south through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California_Peninsula" title="Baja California Peninsula" class="mw-redirect">Baja California</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California_Sur" title="Baja California Sur">Baja California Sur</a>, this inconspicuous non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> resident is most often seen flitting hastily into undergrowth, or heard giving its call, which sounds like a kitten's mew (a rising and falling zeeeeer, zeeeeer).
The California Gnatcatcher's diet consists of small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a>.
In the northern part of its range (Southern California) this species, <i>Polioptila californica</i>, was listed as Threatened by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service" title="United States Fish and Wildlife Service">United States Fish and Wildlife Service</a> in 1993 due to increasing development in its habitat, coastal sage scrub (current loss of coastal sage scrub in U.S is estimated at 70 to 90 percent (Atwood 1991, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.prbo.org/calpif/htmldocs/species/scrub/california_gnatcatcher.html">[1]</a>)). <a href="/w/index.php?title=Critical_Habitat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Critical Habitat (page does not exist)">Critical Habitat</a> designation under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act" title="Endangered Species Act">Endangered Species Act</a> is on hold pending court-ordered review. This species is especially vulnerable as a metapopulation due to its small populations in a limited habitat often live in the prime land to be developed for housing and commerce that can be easily isolated and reduced in size.
Though some of its habitat has been saved in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._National_Forest" title="U.S. National Forest" class="mw-redirect">national forests</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_park" title="State park">state parks</a>, its population has been severely fragmented. There are, however, ongoing efforts to preserve more open land in Southern California to help ensure that this species will not disappear from its former range. California Gnatcatchers are a focal species in many regional habitat conservation planning efforts.
