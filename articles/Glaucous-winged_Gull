The <b>Glaucous-winged Gull</b> (<i>Larus glaucescens</i>) is a large, white-headed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gull</a> residing from the western coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> to the coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(U.S._state)" title="Washington (U.S. state)" class="mw-redirect">Washington</a>. It also breeds on the northwest coast of Alaska. During non-breeding seasons they can be found along the coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>. It is a close relative of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Gull" title="Western Gull">Western Gull</a> and frequently hybridizes with it, resulting in identification problems—particularly in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound" title="Puget Sound">Puget Sound</a> area. Glaucous-winged Gulls are thought to live about 15 years. One individual, notable because he had only one leg, lived at least 30.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from August 2011">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
The Glaucous-winged Gull is rarely found far from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater" title="Seawater">saltwater</a>. It is a large bird, being close in size to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herring_Gull" title="Herring Gull">Herring Gull</a>, which it has a superficial resemblance, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Gull" title="Western Gull">Western Gull</a>, to which it is likely most closely related. It measures 50–68 cm (20–27 in) in length and 120–150 cm (47–59 in), with a body mass of 730–1,690 g (1.6–3.7 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CRC_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Olsen_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Olsen-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> It weighs around 1,010&nbsp;g (2.2&nbsp;lb) on average.<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 39.2 to 48 cm (15.4 to 19 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 4.6 to 6.4 cm (1.8 to 2.5 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 5.8 to 7.8 cm (2.3 to 3.1 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Olsen_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Olsen-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> It has a white head, neck, breast, and belly, a white tail, and pearly-gray wings and back. The term <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucous" title="Glaucous">glaucous</a></i> describes its colouration. The ends of its wings are white-tipped. Its legs are pink and the beak is yellow with a red <a href="/w/index.php?title=Subterminal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Subterminal (page does not exist)">subterminal</a> spot. The forehead is somewhat flat. During the winter, the head and nape appears dusky, and the subterminal spot becomes dark. Young birds are brown or gray with black beaks, and take four years to reach full plumage.
The Glaucous-winged Gull nests in the summer, and each pair produces two or three chicks which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> at six weeks.
It feeds along the coast, scavenging for dead or weak animals, fish, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussel" title="Mussel">mussels</a> and scraps. Its cry is a low-pitched "kak-kak-kak" or "wow", or a more high-pitched wailing.
It is an exceptionally rare vagrant to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Palearctic" title="Western Palearctic" class="mw-redirect">Western Palearctic</a> region, with records from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands" title="Canary Islands">Canary Islands</a> and, most recently, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Britain</a> in the winters of 2006/2007 and 2008/2009.
