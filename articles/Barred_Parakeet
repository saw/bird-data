The <b>Barred Parakeet</b> (<i>Bolborhynchus lineola</i>), also known as <b>Lineolated Parakeet</b>, <b>Catherine Parakeet</b> or 'Linnies' for short, is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot" title="Parrot">parrot</a> found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunct_distribution" title="Disjunct distribution">disjunctly</a> in highland forests from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a>, in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a> from western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> to southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Marta_Mountains" title="Santa Marta Mountains" class="mw-redirect">Santa Marta Mountains</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_Coastal_Range" title="Venezuelan Coastal Range">Venezuelan Coastal Range</a>. Its plumage is mostly green with multiple black and dark green stripes or bars, and it has a pale-horn coloured beak. The dark stripes vary in prominence between its two subspecies. Several colour mutants are available in aviculture.
There are two subspecies of the Barred Parakeet:<sup id="cite_ref-zoonomen_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-zoonomen-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Barred Parakeet is about 16&nbsp;cm (6.5&nbsp;in) in length and has a weight of about 42 to 52&nbsp;grams.<sup id="cite_ref-Forshaw-2006-pl-92_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Forshaw-2006-pl-92-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> It is mostly green and has black stripes (or bars) over its upper-parts except on the top of the head.<sup id="cite_ref-Forshaw-2006-pl-92_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Forshaw-2006-pl-92-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Its lower-parts are olive-green with very dark green stripes on its sides.<sup id="cite_ref-Forshaw-2006-pl-92_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Forshaw-2006-pl-92-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The shoulder of its wings are black, there is some blue on the under-side of its wings, and its tail is dark green.

The Barred Parakeet has a very range in central and South America, and it has a large population that is thought to be stable.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
Some distinct stripes are found, that give them an irrisistable nature.
There are usually four to five eggs in a clutch, which hatch after about 18–21 days of incubation. Chicks leave the nest at about five weeks after hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-DA_2003_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DA_2003-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Lineolated parakeets are found in the wild in groups of six to thirty, although bigger groups (up to 150 birds) are known. They eat fruit, dried and germinated seeds, and insect larvae.
Lineolated parakeets are known for their calm dispositions and peculiar postures. Unlike many birds, lineolateds typically rest in a near horizontal position with their heads almost in line with their tails. They are generally very calm birds and typically mumble quietly, and their calls are not high-pitched or piercing to the ear.
Barred parakeets are popular as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet" title="Pet">pets</a> because of their quiet and even-tempered disposition, and also because many colour mutations are available.<sup id="cite_ref-DA_2003_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DA_2003-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Blue, cobalt, turquoise, mauve, lutino, creamino, cinnamon, golden, pied, silver and violet birds are bred in aviculture. Their average lifespan is about 10 years, but individual birds have been known to live up to 15 years.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from April 2010">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> They are talented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_birds" title="Talking birds" class="mw-redirect">mimics</a> of human speech.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from April 2010">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
Common colors are mainly greens (olive, dark), cobalt, turquoise, grey (also known as mauve), and yellow (or lutino). Dilutes are also available, which generally mark the presence of lighter colors and lighter stripes.
One of the most recognizable and entertaining characteristic of Barred Parakeets is that they enjoy bathing and being misted with water. Barred Parakeets notably enjoy these mist baths; they will hang upside down and open their wings eagerly. Pet Linnies are also known to have a unique trait of liking to burrow or hide in or under clothing for hours on end and will sometimes fall asleep in their found hiding places.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from June 2008">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Linneolated parakeets are known for their soft chatter and low noise levels making them ideal apartment pets. They can sometimes make louder noises but this is normally due to distress or their food dish running low. These birds are also known for their ability to talk and imitate noises. Not all individuals will speak and normally the male of the species is more vocal but there are ways to increase the chance of your bird learning words or sounds including:
Sometimes they will mimic a specific person’s tone, normally the person they spend the most time with. They might additionally learn to imitate noises that are undesirable for them to repeat like bodily functions or swears. Unwanted vocalizations can be minimised by not rewarding the bird with laughter or attention and/or redirecting by getting the bird to perform another known trick like “stepping up”.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Pellets are an ideal base for not only lineolated parakeets, but for many other pet birds as well as it contains many of the essential vitamins and nutrients birds need. Seeds should be fed as a branch of the diet but not as a staple, as a seed-based diet can cause obesity, malnutrition, and kidney failure. Green-leaved vegetables such as kale, collard greens, and turnip greens, as well as broccoli, carrot, and cauliflower are readily consumed. Common fruits that can be offered include banana, papaya, apple, apricot, and orange. Eggs, scrambled or boiled (along with the shell) are an excellent source of protein and calcium. Hemp, roasted soybeans, potatoes, green peas, strawberries, coconut, pumpkin seed, alfalfa, and sunflower seeds are other foods that are consumable. It is good to offer different foods to keep the diet balanced and it keeps them from getting bored but if they seem reluctant to eat a particular food you can pretend to eat it yourself and offer it again.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from April 2010">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
Do not feed your bird anything high in salt, sugar, and fat. Table salt, cooking spray, donuts, chocolate, etc. should never be fed. Common toxic foods include avocado and guacamole, caffeine, fruit pits and apple seeds (contain amounts of cyanide), persimmons, onions (prolonged exposure can lead to a blood condition called hemolytic anemia), mushrooms (fungi should be avoided at all costs; it causes digestion problems and can induce liver failure), dried/uncooked beans (contain hemaglutin, a poison toxic to birds), the stems/vines/leaves of tomatoes (the actual fruit is fine), and eggplant.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from October 2010">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
