<i>Olbiorchilus hiemalis</i><br />
<i>Nannus hiemalis</i>
The <b>Winter Wren</b> (<i>Troglodytes hiemalis</i>) is a very small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American" title="North American" class="mw-redirect">North American</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> and a member of the mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wren" title="Wren">wren</a> family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troglodytidae" title="Troglodytidae" class="mw-redirect">Troglodytidae</a>. It was once lumped with <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Wren" title="Pacific Wren">Troglodytes pacificus</a></i> of western North America and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Wren" title="Eurasian Wren">Troglodytes troglodytes</a></i> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> under the name Winter Wren.
It breeds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coniferous_forest" title="Coniferous forest" class="mw-redirect">coniferous forests</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> to the Atlantic Ocean. It migrates through and winters across southeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, the eastern half the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and (rarely) north-eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Small numbers may be casual in the western United States and Canada.
The scientific name is taken from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> word "troglodytes" (from "trogle" a hole, and "dyein" to creep), meaning "cave-dweller", and refers to its habit of disappearing into cavities or crevices whilst hunting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a> or to roost.
Rufous brown above, grayer below, barred with darker brown and gray, even on wings and tail. The bill is dark brown, the legs pale brown. Young birds are less distinctly barred. Most are identifiable by the pale "eyebrows" over their eyes.
By studying the songs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics" title="Genetics">genetics</a> of individuals in an overlap zone between <i>Troglodytes hiemalis</i> and <i>Troglodytes pacificus</i>, Toews and Irwin (2008)<sup id="cite_ref-pmid18444983_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pmid18444983-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> found strong evidence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_isolation" title="Reproductive isolation">reproductive isolation</a> between the two. It was suggested that the <i>pacificus</i> subspecies be promoted to the species level designation of <i>Troglodytes pacificus</i> with the common name of ‘Pacific Wren’. By applying a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock" title="Molecular clock">molecular clock</a> to the amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA" title="Mitochondrial DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> sequence divergence between the two,<sup id="cite_ref-pmid15129966_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pmid15129966-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> it was estimated that <i>Troglodytes pacificus</i> and <i>Troglodytes troglodytes</i> last shared a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ancestor" title="Common ancestor" class="mw-redirect">common ancestor</a> approximately 4.3 million years ago, long before the glacial cycles of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene" title="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, thought to have promoted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation" title="Speciation">speciation</a> in many avian systems inhabiting the boreal forest of North America.<sup id="cite_ref-pmid15347509_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pmid15347509-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Winter Wren nests mostly in coniferous forests, especially those of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce" title="Spruce">spruce</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir" title="Fir">fir</a>, where it is often identified by its long and exuberant song. Although it is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivore" title="Insectivore">insectivore</a>, it can remain in moderately cold and even snowy climates by foraging for insects on substrates such as bark and fallen logs.
Its movements as it creeps or climbs are incessant rather than rapid; its short flights swift and direct but not sustained, its tiny round wings whirring as it flies from bush to bush.
At night, usually in winter, it often roosts, true to its scientific name, in dark retreats, snug holes and even old nests. In hard weather it may do so in parties, either consisting of the family or of many individuals gathered together for warmth.
For the most part <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a> are its food, but in winter large pupae are taken and some seeds.
The male builds a small number of nests. These are called "cock nests" but are never lined until the female chooses one to use.

Five to eight white or slightly speckled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a> are laid in April, and second broods are reared.
