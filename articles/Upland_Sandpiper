Upland Sandpipers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forage" title="Forage">forage</a> in fields, picking up food by sight. They are frequently sighted on fence posts and even telephone poles. When an "Uppy" allights, it holds it's wings up for a few seconds. While sitting on posts and poles. They are constantly scanning the horizon for intruders.

Upland Sandpipers can sometimes be found in small, loose nesting colonies. The breeding season is from early-to-late summer; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nests</a> are located on the ground in dense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass" title="Grass">grass</a>. The female lays 4 eggs. Both parents look after the young and may perform distraction displays to lure predators away from the nest or young birds.
Upland Sandpipers can be identified by a distinctive call, sometimes called a "wolf whistle", which features a long, ascending whistle followed by a second rising and/or falling call. These sounds are often made while the bird is landing or while flying high.<sup id="cite_ref-Stucker.2C_Steve_2008_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stucker.2C_Steve_2008-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The numbers of these birds increased as forests were cleared in the early 19th century, but declined sharply in the late 19th century due to hunting. They are now regularly present in Midwestern North America but populations are scattered in the east.
Loss of prairie habitat is a concern.<sup id="cite_ref-Stucker.2C_Steve_2008_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stucker.2C_Steve_2008-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Also, livestock grazing has been found to reduce the number of nests in a field.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn" title="Controlled burn">Controlled burns</a> may benefit this species as they feed on low-growing plants that are more easily spotted after a fire.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
