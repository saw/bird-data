The <b>Scissor-tailed Flycatcher</b> (<i>Tyrannus forficatus</i>, also known as the <b>Texas bird-of-paradise</b> and the <b>swallowtailed flycatcher</b>) is a long-tailed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivore" title="Insectivore">insectivorous</a> (insect-eating) bird of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i>Tyrannus</i>, whose members are collectively referred to as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingbird" title="Kingbird">kingbirds</a>. The kingbirds are a group of large insectivorous birds in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher" title="Tyrant flycatcher">tyrant flycatcher</a> (Tyrannidae) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a>. The scissor-tailed flycatcher is found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>.
Its former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> name was <i>Muscivora forficata</i>. The former genus name, <i>Muscivora</i>, derives from the Latin word for "fly" (<i>musca</i>) and "to devour" (<i>vorare</i>), while the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> name <i>forficata</i> derives from the Latin word for "scissors" (<i>forfex</i>). The scissortail now is considered to be a member of the <i>Tyrannus</i>, or "tyrant-like" genus. This genus earned its name because several of its species are extremely aggressive on their breeding territories, where they will attack larger birds such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow" title="Crow">crows</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawks</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owls</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-NPWRC1997_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NPWRC1997-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Adult birds have pale gray heads and upper parts, light underparts, salmon-pink flanks, and dark gray wings. Their extremely long, forked tails, which are black on top and white on the underside, are characteristic and unmistakable. At maturity, the bird may be up to 14.5 inches (37&nbsp;cm) in length. Immature birds are duller in color and have shorter tails. A lot of these birds have been reported to be more than 40&nbsp;cm.
They build a cup nest in isolated trees or shrubs, sometimes using artificial sites such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_pole" title="Telephone pole" class="mw-redirect">telephone poles</a> near towns. The male performs a spectacular aerial display during courtship with his long tail forks streaming out behind him. Both parents feed the young. Like other kingbirds, they are very aggressive in defending their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a>. Clutches contain three to six <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a>.
In the summer, Scissor-tailed flycatchers feed mainly on insects (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper" title="Grasshopper">grasshoppers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber-flies" title="Robber-flies" class="mw-redirect">robber-flies</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonflies" title="Dragonflies" class="mw-redirect">dragonflies</a>), which they may catch by waiting on a perch and then flying out to catch them in flight (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_(birds)" title="Hawking (birds)">hawking</a>). For additional food in the winter they will also eat some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berries" title="Berries" class="mw-redirect">berries</a>.
Their breeding habitat is open shrubby country with scattered trees in the south-central states of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma" title="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>; western portions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>; far eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>; and northeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.
