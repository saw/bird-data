The <b>Canada Goose</b> (<i>Branta canadensis</i>) is a wild <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose" title="Goose">goose</a> with a black head and neck, white patches on the face, and a brownish-gray body. Native to arctic and temperate regions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, it is occasionally found in northern Europe, and has been introduced to other temperate regions.
The Canada Goose was one of the many species described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus" title="Carl Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in his 18th-century work <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae" title="Systema Naturae">Systema Naturae</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It belongs to the <i>Branta</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> of geese, which contains <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> with largely black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a>, distinguishing them from the grey species of the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anser_(genus)" title="Anser (genus)" class="mw-redirect">Anser</a></i> genus.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cackling_Goose" title="Cackling Goose">Cackling Goose</a> was originally considered to be the same species or a subspecies of the Canada Goose, but in July 2004 the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a>'s Committee on Classification and Nomenclature split the two into two species, making Cackling Goose into a full species with the scientific name <i>Branta hutchinsii</i>.

The AOU has divided the many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> between the two animals. To the present species were assigned:
The distinctions between the two geese have led to confusion and debate among ornithologists. This has been aggravated by the overlap between the small types of Canada Goose and larger types of Cackling Goose. The old "Lesser Canada Goose" was believed to be a partly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybrid</a> population, with the birds named <i>taverneri</i> considered a mixture of <i>minima</i>, <i>occidentalis</i> and <i>parvipes</i>. In addition, it has been determined that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle_Goose" title="Barnacle Goose">Barnacle Goose</a> is a derivative of the Cackling Goose lineage, whereas the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Goose" title="Hawaiian Goose" class="mw-redirect">Hawaiian Goose</a> is an insular representative of the Canada Goose.
The black head and neck with a white "chinstrap" distinguish the Canada Goose from all other goose species, with the exception of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle_Goose" title="Barnacle Goose">Barnacle Goose</a>, but the latter has a black breast, and also grey, rather than brownish, body plumage.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> There are seven <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> of this bird, of varying sizes and plumage details, but all are recognizable as Canada Geese. Some of the smaller races can be hard to distinguish from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cackling_Goose" title="Cackling Goose">Cackling Goose</a>, which slightly overlap in mass. However, the Cackling Goose is usually considerably smaller, scarcely larger than a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallard" title="Mallard">Mallard</a> with a much shorter neck and smaller bill.
This species ranges from 75 to 110 cm (30 to 43 in) in length and has a 127–185 cm (50–73 in) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingspan" title="Wingspan">wingspan</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The male usually weighs 3.2–6.5 kg (7.1–14 lb), and can be very aggressive in defending territory.

By the early 20th century, over-hunting and loss of habitat in the late 19th century and early 20th century had resulted in a serious decline in the numbers of this bird in its native range. The Giant Canada Goose subspecies was believed to be extinct in the 1950s until, in 1962, a small flock was discovered wintering in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_Minnesota" title="Rochester, Minnesota">Rochester, Minnesota</a>, by Harold Hanson of the Illinois Natural History Survey.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> With improved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_law" title="Game law">game laws</a> and habitat recreation and preservation programs, their populations have recovered in most of their range, although some local populations, especially of the subspecies <i>occidentalis</i>, may still be declining.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from May 2012">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
In recent years, Canada Goose populations in some areas have grown substantially, so much so that many consider them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism)" title="Pest (organism)">pests</a> for their droppings, bacteria in their droppings, noise, and confrontational behavior. This problem is partially due to the removal of natural <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation" title="Predation">predators</a> and an abundance of safe, man-made bodies of water near food sources, such as those found on golf courses, in public parks and beaches, and in planned communities. Due in part to the interbreeding of various migratory subspecies with the introduced non-migratory Giant subspecies, Canada Geese are frequently a year-around feature of such urban environments.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from May 2012">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Like most geese, the Canada Goose is naturally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> with the wintering range being most of the United States. The calls overhead from large groups of Canada Geese flying in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_formation" title="V formation">V-shaped formation</a> signal the transitions into spring and autumn.

The incubation period, in which the female incubates while the male remains nearby, lasts for 24–28 days after laying. As the annual summer molt also takes place during the breeding season, the adults lose their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">flight feathers</a> for 20–40 days, regaining flight at about the same time as their goslings start to fly.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>
Adult geese are often seen leading their goslings in a line, usually with one parent at the front, and the other at the back. While protecting their goslings, parents often violently chase away nearby creatures, from small blackbirds to lone humans that approach, after warning them by giving off a hissing sound and will then attack with bites and slaps of the wings if the threat does not retreat or has seized a gosling. Most of the species that prey on eggs will also take a gosling. Although parents are hostile to unfamiliar geese, they may form groups of a number of goslings and a few adults, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A8che_(zoology)" title="Crèche (zoology)">crèches</a>.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from March 2011">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
The offspring enter the fledging stage any time from 6 to 9 weeks of age. They do not leave their parents until after the spring migration, when they return to their birthplace.

Canada Geese are known for their seasonal migrations. Most Canada Geese have staging or resting areas where they join up with others. Their autumn migration can be seen from September to the beginning of November. The early migrants have a tendency to spend less time at rest stops and go through the migration a lot faster. The later birds usually spend more time at rest stops. These geese are also renowned for their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_formation" title="V formation">V-shaped</a> flight formation. The front position is rotated since flying in front consumes the most energy. Canada Geese leave the winter grounds more quickly than the summer grounds. Elevated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormones" title="Thyroid hormones" class="mw-redirect">thyroid hormones</a>, such as T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>, have been measured in geese just after a big migration. This is believed because of the long days of flying in migration the thyroid gland sends out more T<sub>4</sub> which will help the body cope with the longer journey. The increased T<sub>4</sub> levels are also associated with increased muscle mass (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy" title="Hypertrophy">hypertrophy</a>) of the breast muscle, also because of the longer time spent flying. It is believed that the body sends out more T<sub>4</sub> to help the goose's body with this long task by speeding up the metabolism and temperature at which the body works.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> Also, other studies show levels of stress hormones like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosterone" title="Corticosterone">corticosterone</a> rise dramatically in these birds during and after a migration.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup>
