The Evening Grosbeak is similar in appearance to the Eurasian Hawfinch, both being bulky, heavily built finches with large bills and short tails. The Evening Grosbeak ranges in length from 16 to 22 cm (6.3 to 8.7 in) in length and spans 30 to 36 cm (12 to 14 in) across the wings.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In a large sampling of grosbeaks in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> during winter, males weighed from 38.7 to 86.1 g (1.37 to 3.04 oz), with an average of 60&nbsp;g (2.1&nbsp;oz), while females weighed from 43.2 to 73.5 g (1.52 to 2.59 oz), with an average of 58.7&nbsp;g (2.07&nbsp;oz).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 10.45 to 11.6 cm (4.11 to 4.6 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail" title="Tail">tail</a> is 6 to 6.95 cm (2.4 to 2.74 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 1.6 to 2 cm (0.63 to 0.79 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 1.95 to 2.2 cm (0.77 to 0.87 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Clement_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Clement-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The adult has a short black tail, black wings and a large pale bill. The adult male has a bright yellow forehead and body; its head is brown and there is a large white patch in the wing.

These birds forage in trees and bushes, sometimes on the ground. They mainly eat seeds, berries and insects. Outside of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesting_season" title="Nesting season">nesting season</a> they often feed in flocks. Sometimes, they will swallow fine gravel.
The range of this bird has expanded far to the east in historical times, possibly due to plantings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba_maple" title="Manitoba maple" class="mw-redirect">Manitoba maples</a> and other maples and shrubs around farms and the availability of bird feeders in winter.
