<i>Catharus mustelinus</i>
The <b>Wood Thrush</b>, <i>Hylocichla mustelina</i>, is a North American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> bird. It is closely related to other thrushes such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Robin" title="American Robin">American Robin</a> and is widely distributed across North America, wintering in Central America and southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. The Wood Thrush is the official bird of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia" title="District of Columbia" class="mw-redirect">District of Columbia</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-50_States_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50_States-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Wood Thrush is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_(bird)" title="Thrush (bird)">thrush</a>, with brown upper parts with mottled brown and white underparts. The male and female are similar in appearance. The male has one of the most beautiful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_call" title="Bird call" class="mw-redirect">songs</a> of birds in North America.
The Wood Thrush is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore" title="Omnivore">omnivore</a>, and feeds preferentially on soil invertebrates and larvae, but will also eat fruits. In the summer, it feeds on insects continuously in order to meet daily metabolic needs. It is solitary, but sometimes form mixed-species flocks. The Wood Thrush defends a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)" title="Territory (animal)">territory</a> that ranges in size from 800 to 28000 square meters. The Wood Thrush is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a>, and its breeding season begins in the spring; about 50 percent of all mated pairs are able to raise two broods, ranging in size from 2 to 4 chicks.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_Laboratory_of_Ornithology_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell_Laboratory_of_Ornithology-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The only member of the genus <i>Hylocichla</i>, the Wood Thrush was described by German <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history" title="Natural history">naturalist</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Gmelin" title="Johann Friedrich Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> in 1789. The generic name is a direct translation of its common name, derived from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Greek</a> words <i>hyle</i>/ύλη "woodland" and <i>cichle</i>/κιχλη "thrush" or "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldfare" title="Fieldfare">fieldfare</a>".<sup id="cite_ref-Liddell_1980_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Liddell_1980-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The specific name comes from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>mustela</i> "weasel".<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> It is closely related to the other typical American thrushes of the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharus" title="Catharus">Catharus</a></i>, and is sometimes merged into that genus;.<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_New_Mexico_Auk_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-University_of_New_Mexico_Auk-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> It has been considered close to the long-distance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrant</a> species of that genus, as opposed to the generally resident nightingale-thrushes, but this appears to be erroneous.<sup id="cite_ref-BioOne_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BioOne-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The Wood Thrush also appears to be fairly closely related to the large <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turdus" title="Turdus" class="mw-redirect">Turdus</a></i> thrushes, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Robin" title="American Robin">American Robin</a>.
The adult Wood Thrush is 18 to 21.5 cm (7.1 to 8.5 in) long, with a wingspan of 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 in) and a body mass of 48 to 72 g (1.7 to 2.5 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-All_About_Birds_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-All_About_Birds-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 9.6 to 11.6 cm (3.8 to 4.6 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 1.6 to 2 cm (0.63 to 0.79 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 2.8 to 3.3 cm (1.1 to 1.3 in). It is distinctly larger than the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharus" title="Catharus">Catharus</a></i> thrushes with which the species is often sympatric but slightly smaller than the common <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Robin" title="American Robin">American Robin</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> The longest known lifespan for a Wood Thrush in the wild is 8&nbsp;years, 11&nbsp;months.<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The crown, nape, and upper back are cinnamon-brown, while the back wings, and tail are a slightly duller brown.

The male and female are similar in size and plumage.
The Wood Thrush has been reported to have one of the most beautiful songs of North American birds.<sup id="cite_ref-Bull87_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bull87-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> American naturalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau" title="Henry David Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> wrote:
Whenever a man hears it he is young, and Nature is in her spring; wherever he hears it, it is a new world and a free country, and the gates of Heaven are not shut against him.
While the female is not known to sing, the male has a unique song that has three parts. The first subsong component is often inaudible unless the listener is close, and consists of two to six short, low-pitched notes such as <i>bup, bup, bup.</i> The middle part is a loud phrase often written <i>ee-oh-lay,</i> and the third part is a ventriloquial, trill-like phrase of non-harmonic pairs of notes given rapidly and simultaneously.
The male is able to sing two notes at once, which gives its song an ethereal, flute-like quality.<sup id="cite_ref-WeidensaulA_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WeidensaulA-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Each individual bird has its own repertoire based on combinations of variations of the three parts. Songs are often repeated in order. The <i>bup, bup, bup</i> phrase is also sometimes used as a call, which is louder and at a greater frequency when the bird is agitated.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_Laboratory_of_Ornithology_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell_Laboratory_of_Ornithology-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The Wood Thrush also use a <i>tut, tut</i> to signal agitation.<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The nocturnal flight call is an emphatic buzzing <i>heeh.</i><sup id="cite_ref-All_About_Birds_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-All_About_Birds-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Wood Thrush prefers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> and mixed forests for breeding. It prefers late-successional, upland mesic forests with a moderately-dense shrub layer. <a href="/w/index.php?title=Robert_I._Bertin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Robert I. Bertin (page does not exist)">Robert I. Bertin</a> (1977) found that this thrush favors areas with running water, moist ground, and high understorey cover.<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology_10-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The breeding habitat generally includes trees taller than 16&nbsp;m (52&nbsp;ft), a fairly open forest floor, moist soil, and leaf litter, with substrate moisture more important than either canopy cover or access to running water. The Wood Thrush can breed in habitat patches as small as 0.4&nbsp;hectares (0.99 acres), but it runs the risk of higher predation and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_effect" title="Edge effect">nest parasitism</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology_10-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The Wood Thrush's breeding range has expanded northward, displacing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veery" title="Veery">Veery</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit_Thrush" title="Hermit Thrush">Hermit Thrush</a> in some locations. In recent times, as a result of fragmentation of forests, it has been increasingly exposed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_effect" title="Edge effect">nest parasitism</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-headed_Cowbird" title="Brown-headed Cowbird">Brown-headed Cowbirds</a>, as well as loss of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a> in the winter range.
The Wood Thrush has become a symbol of the decline of Neotropical songbirds of eastern North America, having declined 43 percent since 1966.<sup id="cite_ref-All_About_Birds_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-All_About_Birds-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Along with many other species, this thrush faces threats both to its North American breeding grounds and Central American wintering grounds. Forest fragmentation in North American forests has resulted in both increased nest predation and increased cowbird parasitism, significantly reducing their reproductive success. A study by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Laboratory_of_Ornithology" title="Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology" class="mw-redirect">Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology</a> was the first large-scale analysis that linked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a> to this thrush's decline.<sup id="cite_ref-Birdscope_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Birdscope-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> Continued destruction of primary forest in Central America eliminated preferred Wood Thrush wintering habitats, likely forcing the birds to choose secondary habitats where mortality rates are higher. In spite of this, the Wood Thrush is still considered to be of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_concern" title="Least concern" class="mw-redirect">least concern</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Wood Thrush has occurred as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrancy_in_birds" title="Vagrancy in birds" class="mw-redirect">vagrant</a> once in Europe, on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isles_of_Scilly" title="Isles of Scilly">Isles of Scilly</a>, England in October 1987.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Wood Thrush is primarily solitary, but occasionally forms mixed-species flocks in the winter. Its breeding territory range from 800 to at least 8000 square meters in size, and are used for nesting, gathering nest materials, and foraging.<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology_10-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Some Wood Thrushes also defend a feeding territory in the winter. Territorial interactions are usually settled without physical contact, but in high-intensity encounters or nest defense, physical interactions with the feet or bill have been observed. Defense behaviors in response to nest predators include wing flicks, tail flicks, and raising the crest, sometimes escalating to dives and strikes.<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology_10-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species has also been observed displaying a behavior known as <i>anting.</i> Anting occurs when a bird picks up a single <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a> or group of ants and rubs them on its feathers. The purpose of this behavior is unknown, but it is thought that the birds may be able to acquire defensive secretions from the ants possibly used for some medicinal purposes, or that it simply supplements the birds' own preen oil.<sup id="cite_ref-All_About_Birds_8-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-All_About_Birds-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
Soil invertebrates and larvae make up most of the Wood Thrush's omnivorous diet, but it will also eat fruits in the late summer, fall, and late winter. It occasionally feeds on arboreal insects, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail" title="Snail">snails</a>, and small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salamander" title="Salamander">salamanders</a>. The young are fed insects and some fruit.<sup id="cite_ref-All_About_Birds_8-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-All_About_Birds-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> After breeding and before migration, the Wood Thrush will switch from insects to fruits with high lipid levels. In the summer, low fruit consumption and lipid reserves require the bird to feed on insects continuously in order to meet its metabolic needs.<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology_10-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Wood Thrush forages mainly on the forest floor, flipping leaves over with their bills to reveal insects. It can be observed hopping around in leaf litter and on semi-bare ground under the forest canopy. Fruits are swallowed whole.<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology_10-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>

Wood Thrushes are monogamous. Breeding pairs form in mid-April to early-May, and usually last throughout the breeding season. Most thrushes find a new mate each year, and mate guarding and extra-pair copulations have not been observed in this species.<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology_10-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Some male Wood Thrushes arrive at the breeding grounds several days before the earliest females while other males arrive at the same time as the females, establishing territories ranging in size from 0.08 to 0.8&nbsp;hectares (one-fifth of an acre to two acres).<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_Laboratory_of_Ornithology_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell_Laboratory_of_Ornithology-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The female typically leads silent circular flights 1–1.8 m (3.3–5.9 ft) from the ground, with the male chasing. Six or more flights generally take place in succession. The pairs will perch together and feed each other in between flights.<sup id="cite_ref-All_About_Birds_8-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-All_About_Birds-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The male begins to sing at dawn and dusk a few days after arriving at breeding grounds. Early in the breeding season, the male sings from high perches in the tallest trees, but as the season progresses, it sings somewhat shorter and less elaborate songs from lower perches. Each day's singing begins and is most intense just before sunrise. The male may sing throughout the day but especially at dusk. The song season is usually over by the end of July.<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology_10-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Typically, the female chooses the nest site and builds the nest. However, there has been some indication that the male is able to influence the selection of the nest site by perching nearby and singing. Usually, though, the female chooses whether or not to accept or reject the nest site suggested by the male.<sup id="cite_ref-Nesting_Behavior_of_the_Wood_Thrush_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Nesting_Behavior_of_the_Wood_Thrush-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> The nest is usually sited in a dense patch of vegetation in a tree or shrub that provides concealment and shade. It is usually made of dead grasses, stems, and leaves, and lined with mud, and placed in a fork at a horizontal branch. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> is not reused. Usually, two broods are attempted, although three to four separate nests may be built before a pair succeeds. Two to four pale blue eggs are laid at the rate of one per day.<sup id="cite_ref-Audubon_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Audubon-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a> are incubated by the female only for 11 to 14 days, with the average being 13 days. Like all passerines, the chicks are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" title="Altricial">altricial</a> at hatching, mostly naked with closed eyes.<sup id="cite_ref-Stanford_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stanford-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> The female broods the chicks during the first four days after hatching. Both parents feed the nestlings and remove fecal sacs from the nest. The chicks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> 12–15&nbsp;days after hatching, but the parents continue to feed them until they become independent and leave the parents' territory at 21–31&nbsp;days old.
The young Wood Thrush is able to begin breeding the next summer. Most females lay their first eggs in mid-May, but older females may begin laying sooner. Pairs usually attempt to rear a second brood no later than late July, with the last of the young fledging around mid-August.<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology_10-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Zoology-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> About half of all Wood Thrush pairs successfully raise two broods.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_Laboratory_of_Ornithology_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell_Laboratory_of_Ornithology-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
