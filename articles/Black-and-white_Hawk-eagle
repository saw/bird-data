The <b>Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle</b> (<i>Spizaetus melanoleucus</i>, formerly <i>Spizastur melanoleucus</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">bird of prey</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle" title="Eagle">eagle</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipitridae" title="Accipitridae">Accipitridae</a>). It is found throughout a large part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical" title="Tropical" class="mw-redirect">tropical</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">America</a>, from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>.
As its name suggest, this is a black and white eagle, resembling the small typical eagles sometimes separated in <i>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieraaetus" title="Hieraaetus">Hieraaetus</a>"</i>. It is some 20-24 in (50–60&nbsp;cm) long overall and weighs about 30 oz (850 g). The head, neck and body are white; a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(feathers)" title="Crest (feathers)">crest</a> forms a black spot on top of the head, and the area around the eyes, particularly towards the bill, is also black. The wings are black, and the bird has a brownish tail barred black-dark grey and with white tip. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(eye)" title="Iris (eye)" class="mw-redirect">iris</a> is orange, the feet pale to bright yellow with black talons. The bill is black with a yellow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cere" title="Cere" class="mw-redirect">cere</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw1_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw1-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The sexes are alike in color, but the female is larger. Immature birds have pale edges on the upperwing coverts and some brownish-grey feathers on the back.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw1_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw1-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle is hard to confuse with any other bird in its range. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-faced_Hawk" title="Black-faced Hawk">Black-faced Hawk</a> (<i>Leucopternis melanops</i>) is very similar in overall coloration, but it is much smaller and has a black tail with a single bold white bar in the middle. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornate_Hawk-Eagle" title="Ornate Hawk-Eagle">Ornate Hawk-Eagle</a> (<i>Spizaetus ornatus</i>), presumably a very close relative of <i>S. melanoleucus</i>, looks quite similar when young. However, the wings, back and tail are much lighter in young <i>S. ornatus</i>, and they do not have the black eye-ring.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw1_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw1-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species occurs from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca" title="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz" title="Veracruz">Veracruz</a> in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> southwards throughout <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, with the exception of most of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Pacific</a> coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>.

The species is absent from western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazonia" title="Amazonia" class="mw-redirect">Amazonia</a>, and it is not common in the lands to the east (e.g. in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_Gerais" title="Minas Gerais">Minas Gerais</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Its natural <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitats</a> are lowland <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forests</a> of any type, though very dense and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid" title="Humid" class="mw-redirect">humid</a> as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savanna</a>-like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiarid" title="Semiarid" class="mw-redirect">semiarid</a> habitat are not preferred. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation" title="Habitat fragmentation">Habitat fragmentation</a> is not very well tolerated; though the species prefers a diverse habitat of mixed forest and shrubland, it requires large stands of closed-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canopy_(forest)" title="Canopy (forest)" class="mw-redirect">canopy</a> forest to thrive. Its range does not extend very far into the uplands, but one individual was sighted at an altitude of about 4,000&nbsp;ft (c.1,200 m) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level" title="Above mean sea level">ASL</a> in the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Buena_Vista_Nature_Reserve&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Buena Vista Nature Reserve (page does not exist)">Buena Vista Nature Reserve</a> in Colombia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_de_Santa_Marta" title="Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta">Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The food of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore" title="Carnivore">carnivore</a> consists of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toad" title="Toad">toads</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamate" title="Squamate" class="mw-redirect">squamates</a> and in particular a wide variety of birds. Among the latter, it is known to prefer tree-living species, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oropendola" title="Oropendola">oropendolas</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aracari" title="Aracari">aracaris</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanager" title="Tanager">tanagers</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotinga" title="Cotinga">cotingas</a>. But ground- and waterbirds like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinamou" title="Tinamou">tinamous</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chachalaca" title="Chachalaca">chachalacas</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormorant" title="Cormorant">cormorants</a> and the highly threatened <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Merganser" title="Brazilian Merganser">Brazilian Merganser</a> (<i>Mergus octosetaceus</i>) have also been recorded as its prey. The Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle has been known to attack small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_monkey" title="New World monkey">monkeys</a>, though it is not clear with which intent. For as it seems, it has not been recorded to actually kill and eat a monkey.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw1_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw1-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Its preferred hunting technique is to soar high until it has spotted suitable prey, and then dive down on it, usually right into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_canopy" title="Forest canopy" class="mw-redirect">forest canopy</a>, but it has also been observed to catch a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Woodpecker" title="White Woodpecker">White Woodpecker</a> (<i>Melanerpes candidus</i>) that had been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing_behavior" title="Mobbing behavior" class="mw-redirect">mobbing</a> it in mid-air, after launching itself from its perch.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> It likes to hunt along ridges and forest edges where it can access the canopy-level from an oblique direction rather than just from directly above, and where ground-living prey is also more accessible.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw1_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw1-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
It nests in the forest canopy, building a stick nest high up in exposed trees on ridges and similar locations, from where good hunting grounds can be watched. Detailed observations on its nesting habits are nearly non-existent however. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a>, birds started to construct a nest in September, during a dry spell in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainy_season" title="Rainy season" class="mw-redirect">rainy season</a>. But the main nesting season may start before the onset of the rainy season as the nesting attempt was abandoned when heavy rains recommenced. The scant other data agrees with this, and at least in Central America the nesting season seems to run from March to June or so.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw1_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw1-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
There is a general lack of information on the Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle's movements and population status. Each bird seems to require a hunting territory of about 3,500 acres (1,400 hectars) at least. While the variety of habitat types in which it is found suggests that it is not particularly susceptible to changes in land use, it is apparently still a rare and local species almost anywhere in its range. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a> until 2000 classified it as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Threatened" title="Near Threatened">Near Threatened</a> species due to the uncertainties surrounding its status, but as no evidence of a marked decline has been found and as the bird is found across a wide range, it was downlisted to a Species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern" title="Least Concern">Least Concern</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species is often placed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic" title="Monotypic" class="mw-redirect">monotypic</a> genus <i><b>Spizastur</b></i>, but has recently been moved to <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spizaetus" title="Spizaetus">Spizaetus</a></i> e.g. by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a>, as it appears that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornate_Hawk-Eagle" title="Ornate Hawk-Eagle">Ornate Hawk-Eagle</a> (<i>S. ornatus</i>) is its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_taxon" title="Sister taxon" class="mw-redirect">sister taxon</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> This has created quite some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic" title="Taxonomic" class="mw-redirect">taxonomic</a> confusion, which has largely gone unnoticed however:
Originally, the name <i>Spizaetus melanoleucus</i> was given by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Jean_Pierre_Vieillot" title="Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot">Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-chested_Buzzard-Eagle" title="Black-chested Buzzard-Eagle">Black-chested Buzzard-Eagle</a> in 1819, while the Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle had been described in 1816 by the very same scientist as <i>Buteo melanoleucus</i>. The former species was placed in <i>Geranoaetus</i> – also a monotypic genus – in 1844, while the Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle had been moved out of <i>Buteo</i> and into <i>Spizastur</i> a few years earlier.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
Thus, the identical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_name_(zoology)" title="Specific name (zoology)">specific epithets</a> never came into direct conflict until recently. But the Black-chested Eagle-buzzard's placement in a monotypic genus was always disputed, and several authors treated it in <i>Buteo</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> However, they overlooked that <i>Buteo melanoleucus</i> was the original name of the Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle and thus as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_homonym" title="Senior homonym" class="mw-redirect">senior homonym</a> could not be applied to the later-described species. The correct specific name for the Black-chested Eagle-buzzard when placed in <i>Buteo</i>, <i>Buteo fuscescens</i>, was reestablished in the mid-20th century for a short time more by accident than anything else;<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> as most late-20th-century researchers argued for retaining <i>Geranoaetus</i>, this name was dismissed as erroneous and essentially forgotten.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
As the Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle has not been placed in <i>Buteo</i> since long, Article 59.3 of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature" title="International Code of Zoological Nomenclature">ICZN</a> Code applies. According to this, a junior homonym replaced before 1961 is <i>not</i> rendered permanently invalid (as junior homonyms usually are) if "the substitute name is not in use"<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> – which has been the case after Amadon's 1963 revision. Hence, in this case the scientific name <i>Buteo melanoleucus</i> can apply to the Black-chested Eagle-buzzard, even though the Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle was described under exactly that name earlier, while the senior homonym <i>melanoleucus</i> still applies to the latter species when placed in <i>Spizaetus</i> according to the usual ICZN rules. Consequently, the proper name to use for each bird has through a number of coincidences become the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_synonym" title="Senior synonym" class="mw-redirect">senior synonym</a> of the other species.
