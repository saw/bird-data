<i>Merganser americanus</i> Cassin, 1852
The <b>Common Merganser</b> (North American) or <b>Goosander</b> (Eurasian) (<i>Mergus merganser</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck" title="Duck">duck</a>, of rivers and lakes of forested areas of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, northern and central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. It eats fish and nests in holes in trees. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Audubon" title="John James Audubon">John James Audubon</a> called this bird the "Buff-breasted Merganser" in his book <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birds_of_America" title="The Birds of America">The Birds of America</a></i>.
It is 58–72 cm (23–28 in) long with a 78–97 cm (31–38 in) wingspan, and a weight of 0.9–2.1 kg (2.0–4.6 lb); males average slightly larger than females but with some overlap. Like other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergus" title="Mergus">Mergus</a></i>, it has a crest of longer head feathers, but these usually lie smoothly rounded behind the head, not normally forming an erect crest. Adult males in breeding plumage are easily distinguished, the body white with a variable salmon-pink tinge, the head black with an iridescent green gloss, the rump and tail grey, and the wings largely white on the inner half, black on the outer half. Females, and males in "eclipse" (non-breeding plumage, July to October) are largely grey, with a reddish-brown head, white chin, and white secondary feathers on the wing. Juveniles (both sexes) are similar to adult females but also show a short black-edged white stripe between the eye and bill. The bill and legs are red to brownish-red, brightest on adult males, dullest on juveniles.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoyo_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hoyo-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Madge_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Snow_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Snow-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
There are three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>, differing in only minor detail:<sup id="cite_ref-Hoyo_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hoyo-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Madge_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Like the other mergansers, these fish-feeding ducks have serrated edges to their bills to help them grip their prey; they are therefore often known as "sawbills". In addition to fish, they take a wide range of other aquatic prey, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusc" title="Mollusc" class="mw-redirect">molluscs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>, worms, insect larvae, and amphibians; more rarely, small mammals and birds may be taken.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoyo_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hoyo-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Madge_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> As in other birds with the character, the salmon-pink tinge shown variably by males is probably diet-related, obtained from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotenoid" title="Carotenoid">carotenoid</a> pigments present in some crustaceans and fish.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> When not diving for food, they are usually seen swimming on the water surface, or resting on rocks in midstream or hidden among riverbank vegetation, or (in winter) on the edge of floating ice.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoyo_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hoyo-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Madge_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
In most places, the Common Merganser is nearly as much a salt-water as a fresh-water frequenter. In larger streams and rivers, they float down with the stream for a couple of miles, and either fly back again or more commonly fish their way back, diving incessantly the whole way. In smaller streams, they are present in pairs or smaller groups, and they float down, twisting round and round in the rapids, or fishing vigorously in some deep pool near the foot of some waterfall or rapid. When floating leisurely, they position themselves in water similar to ducks. But they swim deep in water like Cormorants too, especially when swimming upstream. They often sit on some rock in the middle of the water, similar to Cormorants, often half-opening their wings to the sun. In order to rise from water, they flap along the surface for many yards. Once they are airborne the flight is strong and rapid.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> They often fish in as a group forming a semicircle and driving the fish into a shallow, where they are captured easily. Their ordinary voice is a low, harsh croak but during the breeding season they (including the young one) makes a plaintive, soft whistle. Generally, they are wary and one or more birds stay on sentry duty to warn the flock on the approach of danger. And when disturbed, they often disgorge food before moving.<sup id="cite_ref-fbi6_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-fbi6-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Though they move clumsily on land, they resort to running when pressed, assuming a very upright position similar to penguins, and falling and stumbling frequently.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">Nesting</a> is normally in a tree cavity, thus it requires mature forest as its breeding habitat; they also readily use large nest boxes where provided, requiring an entrance hole 15&nbsp;cm diameter.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> In places devoid of trees (like Central Asian mountains), they use holes in cliffs and steep, high banks, sometimes at considerable distances from the water.<sup id="cite_ref-fbi6_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-fbi6-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The female lays 6–17 (most often 8–12) white to yellowish eggs, and raises one brood in a season. The ducklings are taken by their mother in her bill to rivers or lakes immediately after hatching, where they feed on freshwater invertebrates and small fish fry, fledging when 60–70 days old. The young are sexually mature at two years old.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoyo_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hoyo-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Madge_3-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Snow_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Snow-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The species is a partial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrant</a>, with birds moving away from areas where rivers and major lakes freeze in the winter, but resident where waters remain open. Eastern North American birds move south in small groups to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> wherever ice free conditions exist on lakes and rivers; on the milder Pacific coast, they are permanent residents. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavian</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russian</a> birds also migrate southwards, but western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> birds, and a few in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, are largely resident.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoyo_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hoyo-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Madge_3-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In some populations, the males also show distinct moult migration, leaving the breeding areas as soon as the young hatch to spend the summer (June to September) elsewhere. Notably, most of the western European male population migrates north to estuaries in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnmark" title="Finnmark">Finnmark</a> in northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a> (principally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanafjord" title="Tanafjord">Tanafjord</a>) to moult, leaving the females to care for the ducklings. Much smaller numbers of males also use estuaries in eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> as a moulting area.<sup id="cite_ref-Snow_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Snow-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
Overall, the species is not threatened, though illegal persecution by game fishing interests is a problem in some areas.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
Within western Europe, there has been a marked southward spread from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> in the breeding range since about 1850, colonising <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> in 1871, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> in 1941, and also a strong increase in the population in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps" title="Alps">Alps</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Snow_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Snow-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> They are very scarce in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>.
The Goosander is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEWA" title="AEWA" class="mw-redirect">AEWA</a>) applies.<br style="clear: left;" />
