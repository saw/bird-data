The Violet-crowned Woodnymph is a common to abundant bird of wet lowlands and foothills to 2500 m, and may move higher when not breeding. The female Violet-crowned Woodnymph is entirely responsible for nest building and incubation. She lays two white eggs in a plant-fibre cup nest 1–5 m high on a horizontal branch. Incubation takes 15–19 days, and fledging another 20-26.
The adult male Violet-crowned Woodnymph is 10.2&nbsp;cm long and weighs 4.5 g. It has a violet crown, upper back, shoulders and belly, a shiny green throat and breast, green lower back, and a deeply forked blue-black tail. The female is 8.4–9&nbsp;cm long and weighs 3.5 g. She is bright green above and duller green below, with a grey throat and breast. Her tail is rounded, mainly green near the body but with a blue-black lower half and white corners. Young males lack any violet or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence" title="Iridescence">iridescence</a> and are bronze-coloured below. Immature females have buff fringes on the feathers of the nape, face and rump. The call is a high-pitched fast <i>kip</i>.
The food of this species is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectar" title="Nectar">nectar</a>, taken from a variety of flowers. Males feed in the canopy, where their food plants include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyte" title="Epiphyte">epiphytic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ericaceae" title="Ericaceae">Ericaceae</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromeliad" title="Bromeliad" class="mw-redirect">bromeliads</a>, and defend flowers and scrubs in their feeding territories. Females stay in the understory. After breeding, both sexes may concentrate at <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliconia" title="Heliconia">Heliconias</a></i>. Like other hummingbirds, Violet-crowned Woodnymph also takes small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a> as an essential source of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a>.
