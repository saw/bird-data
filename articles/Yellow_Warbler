The <b>Yellow Warbler</b> (<i>Setophaga petechia</i>, formerly <i>Dendroica petechia</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_warbler" title="New World warbler">New World warbler</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a>. <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensu_lato" title="Sensu lato" class="mw-redirect">Sensu lato</a></i>, they make up the most widespread species in the diverse <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setophaga" title="Setophaga">Setophaga</a></i> genus, breeding in almost the whole of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and down to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>.
Other than in male <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">breeding plumage</a> and body size, all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> are very similar. Winter, female and immature birds all have similarly greenish-yellow uppersides and are a duller yellow below. Young males soon acquire breast and, where appropriate, head coloration. Females are somewhat duller, most notably on the head. In all, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">remiges</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">rectrices</a> are blackish olive with yellow edges, sometimes appearing as an indistinct wing-band on the former. The eyes and the short thin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">beak</a> are dark, while the feet are lighter or darker olive-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buff_(colour)" title="Buff (colour)">buff</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-bachynskikadlec2003_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bachynskikadlec2003-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Curson_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Curson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The 35 subspecies of <i>D. petechia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensu_lato" title="Sensu lato" class="mw-redirect">sensu lato</a></i> can be divided into three main groups according to the males' head color in the breeding season.<sup id="cite_ref-Curson_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Curson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Each of these groups is sometimes considered a separate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a>, or the <i>aestiva</i> group (Yellow Warbler) is considered a species different from <i>D. petechia</i> (Mangrove Warbler, including Golden Warbler); the latter option is the one currently accepted by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ornithological_Congress" title="International Ornithological Congress">International Ornithological Congress</a> <i>World Bird List</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-IOC_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IOC-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Depending on subspecies, the Yellow Warbler may be between 10–18 cm (3.9–7.1 in) long, with a wingspan from 16 to 22 cm (6.3 to 8.7 in). They weigh 7–25 g (0.25–0.88 oz), varying between subspecies and whether on migration or not, globally averaging about 16&nbsp;g (0.56&nbsp;oz) but only 9–10 g (0.32–0.35 oz) in most breeding adults of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">United States</a> populations. Among standard measurements throughout the subspecies, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 5.5 to 7 cm (2.2 to 2.8 in), the tail is 3.9 to 5.6 cm (1.5 to 2.2 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 0.8 to 1.3 cm (0.31 to 0.51 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 1.7 to 2.2 cm (0.67 to 0.87 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Curson_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Curson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The summer males of this species are generally the yellowest "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warbler" title="Warbler">warblers</a>" wherever they occur. They are brilliant yellow below and golden-green above. There are usually a few wide washed-out rusty-red streaks on the breast and flanks.

The <b>Golden Warbler</b> (<b><i>petechia</i> group</b>; 17 subspecies<sup id="cite_ref-Curson_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Curson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>) is generally resident in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove" title="Mangrove">mangrove</a> swamps of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies" title="West Indies" class="mw-redirect">West Indies</a>. Local seasonal migrations may occur. On the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands" title="Cayman Islands">Cayman Islands</a> for example, <i>D. p. eoa</i> was found to be "decidedly scarce" on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Cayman" title="Grand Cayman">Grand Cayman</a> and apparently absent from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Brac" title="Cayman Brac">Cayman Brac</a> in November 1979, while it had been a "very common" breeder in the group some 10 years before, and not frequently seen in the winters of 1972/1973; apparently, the birds disperse elsewhere outside the breeding season. The Cuban Golden Warbler (<i>D. p. gundlachi</i>) barely reaches the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Keys" title="Florida Keys">Florida Keys</a> where it was first noted in 1941, and by the mid-20th century a breeding population was resident.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Though individual birds may stray farther north, their distribution is restricted by the absence of mangrove habitat.
They are generally smallish, usually weighing about 10&nbsp;g (0.35&nbsp;oz) or less and sometimes<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> as little as 6.5&nbsp;g (0.23&nbsp;oz). The summer males differs from those of the Yellow Warbler in that they have a rufous crown, hood or mask. The races in this group vary in the extent and hue of the head patch.
The <b>Mangrove Warbler</b> (<b><i>erithachorides</i> group</b>; 12 subspecies<sup id="cite_ref-Curson_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Curson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>) tends to be larger than other Yellow Warbler subspecies groups, averaging 12.5&nbsp;cm (4.9&nbsp;in) in length and 11&nbsp;g (0.39&nbsp;oz) in weight. It is resident in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove" title="Mangrove">mangrove</a> swamps of coastal Middle America and northern South America; <i>D. p. aureola</i> is found on the oceanic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands" title="Galápagos Islands">Galápagos Islands</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Curson_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Curson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The summer males differ from those of the Yellow Warbler in that they have a rufous hood or crown.

The song is a musical strophe that can be rendered <i>sweet sweet sweet, I'm so sweet</i>, although it varies considerably between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population" title="Population">populations</a>. The call is a soft or harder <i>chip</i> or <i>ship</i>. This is particularly frequently given by females after a male has finishing his song. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(biology)" title="Territory (biology)" class="mw-redirect">territorial</a> defence, they give hissing calls, while <i>seet</i> seems to be a kind of specialized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowbird" title="Cowbird">cowbird</a> alert (see <a href="#Breeding">below</a>). Other calls are given in communication between pair-members, neighbors, or by young begging for food. These birds also communicate with postures and perhaps with touch.<sup id="cite_ref-bachynskikadlec2003_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bachynskikadlec2003-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
Yellow Warblers breed in most of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a> southwards, but they do not range far southwestwards and avoid the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> coasts also.<sup id="cite_ref-bachynskikadlec2003_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bachynskikadlec2003-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The Mangrove and Golden Warblers occur to the south of it, to the northern reaches of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a>. Yellow Warblers winter to the south of their breeding range, from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Basin" title="Amazon Basin">Amazon</a> region, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-bachynskikadlec2003_1-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bachynskikadlec2003-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
Yellow Warblers arrive in their breeding range in late spring – generally about April/May – and move to winter quarters again starting as early as July, as soon as the young are fledged. Most, however, stay a bit longer; by the end of August, the bulk of the northern populations has moved south, though some may linger almost until fall. At least in northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>, Yellow Warblers do not seem to remain on their breeding grounds longer than they did 100 years ago.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The breeding habitat of Yellow Warblers is typically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian" title="Riparian" class="mw-redirect">riparian</a> or otherwise moist land with ample growth of small trees, in particular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow" title="Willow">willows</a> (<i>Salix</i>). The other groups, as well as wintering birds, chiefly inhabit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove" title="Mangrove">mangrove</a> swamps and similar dense woody growth. Less preferred habitat are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrubland" title="Shrubland">shrubland</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arable_land" title="Arable land">farmlands</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forest</a> edges. In particular Yellow Warblers will come to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb" title="Suburb">suburban</a> or less densely settled areas, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard" title="Orchard">orchards</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks" title="Parks" class="mw-redirect">parks</a>, and may well breed there. Outside the breeding season, these warblers are usually encountered in small groups, but while breeding they are fiercely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(biology)" title="Territory (biology)" class="mw-redirect">territorial</a> and will try to chase away any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific" title="Conspecific" class="mw-redirect">conspecific</a> intruder that comes along.<sup id="cite_ref-bachynskikadlec2003_1-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bachynskikadlec2003-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
These birds feed mainly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a>, in particular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>. They acquire prey by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleaning_(birds)" title="Gleaning (birds)">gleaning</a> in shrubs and on tree branches, and by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_(birds)" title="Hawking (birds)">hawking</a> prey that tries to fly away.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator" class="mw-redirect">predators</a> of Yellow and Mangrove Warblers are those typical of such smallish tree-nesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerines</a>. The odds of an adult Yellow Warbler to survive from one year to the next are on average 50%; in the southern populations, by contrast, about two-thirds of the adults survive each year. Conversely, less than one Yellow Warbler nest in three on average suffers from predation in one way or another, while two out of three Mangrove and Golden Warbler nests are affected.<sup id="cite_ref-bs0308_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bs0308-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>

These New World warblers seem to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing_behaviour" title="Mobbing behaviour" class="mw-redirect">mob</a> predators only rarely. An exception are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowbird" title="Cowbird">cowbirds</a>, which are significant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite" title="Brood parasite">brood parasites</a>. The Yellow Warbler is a regular host of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-headed_Cowbird" title="Brown-headed Cowbird">Brown-headed Cowbird</a> (<i>Molothrus ater</i>), with about 40% of all nests suffering attempted or successful parasitism. By contrast, the tropical populations are host to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiny_Cowbird" title="Shiny Cowbird">Shiny Cowbird</a> (<i>M. bonariensis</i>), but less than one nest in 10 is affected. Upon recognizing a cowbird egg in its nest, the warbler will often smother it with a new layer of nesting material. It will usually not try to save any own eggs that have already been laid, but produce a replacement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)" title="Clutch (eggs)">clutch</a>. Sometimes, the parents desert a parasitized nest altogether and build a new one. Unlike some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo" title="Cuckoo">cuckoos</a>, cowbird nestlings will not actively kill the nestlings of the host bird; mixed broods of <i>Dendroica</i> and <i>Molothrus</i> may <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> successfully.<sup id="cite_ref-bs0308_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bs0308-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Other than due to predation, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death" title="Death">mortality</a> reasons are not well known. The maximum recorded ages<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> of wild Yellow Warblers are around 10 years. A wintering Yellow Warbler examined near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo,_Colombia" title="Turbo, Colombia">Turbo, Colombia</a> was not infected with blood <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism" title="Parasitism">parasites</a>, unlike other species in the study. It is unclear whether this significant, but wintering birds in that region generally lacked such parasites.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
As usual for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_warblers" title="New World warblers" class="mw-redirect">New World warblers</a> (Parulidae), they nest in trees, building a small but very sturdy cup nest. Females and males share the reproductive work about equally, but emphasize different tasks: females are more involved with building and maintaining the nest, and incubating and brooding the offspring. Most of the actual feeding is also done by them. Males are more involved in guarding the nest site and procuring food, bringing it to the nest and passing it to the waiting mother. As the young approach <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledging" title="Fledging" class="mw-redirect">fledging</a>, the male's workload becomes proportionally higher.<sup id="cite_ref-bachynskikadlec2003_1-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bachynskikadlec2003-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Yellow and Mangrove (including Golden) Warblers differ in some other reproductive parameters. While the former is somewhat more of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-strategist" title="R-strategist" class="mw-redirect">r-strategist</a>, the actual differences are complex and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation" title="Adaptation">adapted</a> to different environmental conditions. The Yellow Warbler starts breeding in May/June, while the Mangrove Warbler can be found breeding all year round. Yellow Warblers have been known to raise a brood of young in as little as 45 days, but usually take about 75 days. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical" title="Tropical" class="mw-redirect">tropical</a> populations, by contrast, need more than 100 days per breeding. Males court the females with songs; a Yellow Warbler has been observed to sing more than 3,200 songs in one day. They are, like most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbirds</a>, generally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_monogamy" title="Serial monogamy" class="mw-redirect">serially monogamous</a>; some 10% of Mangrove Warbler and about half as many Yellow Warbler males are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigamous" title="Bigamous" class="mw-redirect">bigamous</a>. Very few if any Yellow Warblers breed more than once per year; around one in twenty Mangrove Warbler females will do so however. If a breeding attempt fails, either will usually try and raise a second brood successfully though.<sup id="cite_ref-bs0308_10-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bs0308-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)" title="Clutch (eggs)">clutch</a> of the Yellow Warbler is 3–6 (typically 4–5, rarely 1–2) eggs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">Incubation</a> to hatching usually takes 11 days, but may take up to two weeks. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestling" title="Nestling" class="mw-redirect">nestlings</a> weigh 1.3&nbsp;g (0.046&nbsp;oz) on average, and are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooding" title="Brooding" class="mw-redirect">brooded</a> for an average 8–9 days after hatching, and leave the nest the following day or the one thereafter. Mangrove Warblers, on the other hand, have only 3 eggs per clutch on average and incubate some 2 days longer. Its average post-hatching brooding time is 11 days. Almost half of the parents (somewhat more in the Mangrove Warbler, somewhat less in the Yellow Warbler) attend the fledglings for some time after these leave the nest. This post-fledging care can extend for two additional weeks or more, and sometimes the pairs separate early, each accompanied by one to three of the young.<sup id="cite_ref-bsa030809_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bsa030809-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>
Some 3–4 weeks after hatching, the young are fully independent of their parents. They become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_mature" title="Sexually mature" class="mw-redirect">sexually mature</a> at one year of age, and attempt to breed right away. Only about one in four Mangrove Warbler nests successfully fledge any offspring, due to accidents and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator" class="mw-redirect">predation</a> frequently causing total loss of the clutch. By contrast, 55% of all Yellow Warbler nestings are successful in raising at least one young.<sup id="cite_ref-bsa030809_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bsa030809-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>
To humans, these birds are quite beneficial. For one thing, in particular the young devour many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism)" title="Pest (organism)">pest</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> during the breeding season. For another, the plumage and song of the breeding males have been described<sup id="cite_ref-bachynskikadlec2003_1-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bachynskikadlec2003-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> as "lovely" and "musical", and they can help to generate revenue from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotourism" title="Ecotourism">ecotourism</a>.
