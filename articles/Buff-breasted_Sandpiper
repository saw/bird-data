The <b>Buff-breasted Sandpiper</b>, <i>Tryngites subruficollis</i>, is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">shorebird</a>. It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calidrid" title="Calidrid">calidrid</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandpiper" title="Sandpiper">sandpipers</a> and currently considered to be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypical" title="Monotypical" class="mw-redirect">only member</a> of the genus <i>Tryngites</i>. Indeed, it probably belongs in the genus <i>Calidris</i> itself, or more precisely with the small species thereof which should be split into a distinct genus (Thomas <i>et al.</i>, 2004). Depending on whether this would include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curlew_Sandpiper" title="Curlew Sandpiper">Curlew Sandpiper</a> or not, the name <i>Erolia</i> would or would not, respectively, apply.
This species is brown above, and has a buff face and underparts in all plumages. It has a short bill and yellow legs. Males are larger than females. Juveniles resemble the adults, but may be paler on the rear underparts.
<i>T. subruficollis</i> breeds in the open arctic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and is a very long-distance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrant</a>, spending the non-breeding season mainly in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>.
It <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrates</a> mainly through central North America, and is uncommon on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast" title="Coast">coasts</a>. It occurs as a regular wanderer to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and is not classed as rare in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, where small flocks have occurred. Only the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectoral_Sandpiper" title="Pectoral Sandpiper">Pectoral Sandpiper</a> is a more common American shorebird visitor to Europe.
This species nests on the ground, laying four <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a>. The male has a display which includes raising the wings to display the white undersides, which is also given on migration, sometimes when no other Buff-breasted Sandpipers are present. Outside the breeding season, this bird is normally found on short-grass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitats</a> such as airfields or golf-courses, rather than near water.
These birds pick up food by sight, mainly eating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a>. They are often very tame.
Buff-breasted Sandpipers are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridisation_in_shorebirds#Other_hybrid_scolopacids" title="Hybridisation in shorebirds">suspected</a> to have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybridized</a> with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-rumped_Sandpiper" title="White-rumped Sandpiper">White-rumped</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baird%27s_Sandpiper" title="Baird's Sandpiper">Baird's Sandpiper</a>.
This species has been sighted in South Asia on at least three occasions. It is believed that instead of going to Argentina, this bird might have been wind-blown from the Great Plains Flyway of North America and landed up in South Asia. In 2011, November this species was sighted near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannur" title="Kannur">Kannur</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala" title="Kerala">Kerala</a> in South India.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
