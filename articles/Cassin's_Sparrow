The Cassin's Sparrow is a fairly large, plain, grayish sparrow that lacks conspicuous markings. In flight, the long, roundish tail is obvious and the white tips of the tail feathers are sometimes apparent. This species is most easily identified by its distinctive song and dramatic skylarking behavior during the breeding season. Although often characterized in the literature as secretive and difficult to observe when not singing,<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="#CITEREFSchnase1984">Schnase (1984</a>) observed that Cassin's Sparrows readily accommodated the presence of an observer, especially early in the breeding season.
Adult - The head is brown streaked with gray and dark brown; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercilium" title="Supercilium">supercilium</a> is buff, and there is a thin, dark brown <a href="/w/index.php?title=Submoustachial_stripe&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Submoustachial stripe (page does not exist)">submoustachial stripe</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is brownish gray, with darker upper mandible and pale bluish gray tomial edge and lower mandible. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" title="Iris (anatomy)">iris</a> is dark brown. The chin, throat and breast are pale gray or brownish gray; the belly is whitish; and there are a few well-defined dark brown or black streaks on the lower flanks. On the back, the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Mantle_(bird_anatomy)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mantle (bird anatomy) (page does not exist)">mantle</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Scapulars&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Scapulars (page does not exist)">scapulars</a> are described as brown or gray with a rusty tinge, the feathers having dark brown <a href="/w/index.php?title=Subterminal_spot&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Subterminal spot (page does not exist)">subterminal spots</a> and edged with buff or gray, giving a scaly or variegated appearance. Wings are brown; greater <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_(feather)" title="Covert (feather)" class="mw-redirect">coverts</a> are broadly tipped and narrowly edged with buff or grayish white, forming a wing bar variously described as fairly conspicuous to indistinct. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alula" title="Alula">alula</a> is pale yellow. Feathers in the upper tail coverts have a gray edge, a brown center, and a black subterminal crescent. The undertail coverts are buffy. Most of the upper side of the tail is dark, dusky brown, but the central two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectrix" title="Rectrix" class="mw-redirect">rectrices</a> are pale brownish gray with a serrated dark central strip that spreads out into a suggestion of faint crossbars. The lateral two rectrices are edged and tipped in pale gray or white, with smaller pale areas at the tips of the next two pairs inward. This is sometimes noticeable on a bird flushing or flying away, but it is not always apparent, and by late summer, pale tips may be partly or completely worn away. Legs are described as dull pinkish or dark flesh.<sup id="cite_ref-Plumage_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Plumage-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
Juvenile - Juveniles are similar to adults with a brown back, feathers with buffy tips and darker brown central streaks, greater coverts edged with white, and light streaking on breast and throat.<sup id="cite_ref-Plumage_14-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Plumage-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
<a href="#CITEREFByersCursonOlsson1995">Byers, Curson &amp; Olsson (1995</a>) noted that some birds, mainly in the eastern part of their range, tend to be more rufous above, slightly buffier below, and have plainer tails with less obvious shaft streaks and barring on the central rectrices.

The Cassin's Sparrow's primary song consists of six note complexes, beginning with a soft double or single introductory note, followed by a long, high musical trill on one pitch, and (usually) two lower, well-spaced musical notes, all with a slight minor-key quality. There is enough individual variation in this song that it has been used as a means of identifying individual males in population studies.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESchnaseMaxwell1989_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchnaseMaxwell1989-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> A secondary song, or "chitter" song,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWolf1977_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWolf1977-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> consists of a series of chips, trills, and buzzy notes preceding the primary song.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESchnase1984_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchnase1984-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> Cassin's Sparrows also give a variety of chitter calls and chip notes that have been assigned various roles by different authors, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_bond" title="Pair bond">pair bond</a> maintenance, communication with fledglings, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_call" title="Alarm call" class="mw-redirect">alarm calls</a>, territory defense, etc.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Unusual conditions may induce this species to sing at unusual times of year.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKaufman1990_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKaufman1990-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>
Territorial males sit in low bushes or grass, or on the ground to sing, but often give spectacular flight-songs. At the beginning of the breeding season, all song is from a stationary, exposed perch and often involves reciprocal proclamation of the primary song among males. Flight songs and skylarking are infrequent until later, in association with the presence of returning females.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> In flight songs (or skylarking), the territorial male flies up from an exposed perch, such as a bush, to as much as 5 – 10 m in the air, then sings as he glides or flutters down in an arc to a nearby bush or the ground. During the descent, wings are held flat, the head is arched backwards, and the tail is elevated. Song can be heard from mid-February to early September, depending on location, with considerable night singing at the height of the season reported by some.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup>
The bird's diet consists of insects and seeds.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup>
The summer diet of Cassin's Sparrows consists primarily of insects, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper" title="Grasshopper">grasshoppers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar" title="Caterpillar">caterpillars</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle" title="Beetle">beetles</a>.

However, <a href="#CITEREFWolf1977">Wolf (1977</a>) reported that the stomachs of ten adults taken during the breeding season (late June and early July) contained animal and vegetable matter in about equal proportions (52% and 48%, respectively; range = 5–95%).

There is a report of Cassin's Sparrows eating flower buds of blackthorn bush (<i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Condalia_spathulata&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Condalia spathulata (page does not exist)">Condalia spathulata</a></i>) in season.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEOberholser1974_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOberholser1974-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> In fall and winter, Cassin's Sparrows eat the seeds of weeds and grasses.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="#CITEREFOberholser1974">Oberholser (1974</a>) particularly mentions the consumption of seeds of chickweed (<a href="/w/index.php?title=Alsinaceae&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Alsinaceae (page does not exist)">Alsinaceae</a> family), plantain (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantago" title="Plantago">Plantago</a></i> spp.), woodsorrel (<i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Xanthoxalis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Xanthoxalis (page does not exist)">Xanthoxalis</a></i> spp.), sedge (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carex" title="Carex">Carex</a></i> spp.), panicum (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panicum" title="Panicum">Panicum</a></i> spp.), other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass" title="Grass">grasses</a>, and sorghum (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorghum" title="Sorghum">Sorghum</a></i> spp.).
<a href="#CITEREFSchnase1984">Schnase (1984</a>) reports observing birds drinking water from a small pool immediately following a rain. Although <a href="#CITEREFWilliamsLeSassier1968">Williams &amp; LeSassier (1968</a>) report that Cassin's Sparrows seem to exist very well without drinking water, their conclusion appears to be based on the limited number of recorded observations of this species drinking water, the distance of most nesting areas from water, and the fact that birds rarely leave their territories.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERuth20006_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERuth20006-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup>
Cassin's Sparrows forage mostly or entirely on the ground, hopping about in relatively open areas, taking items from the ground or from plant stems.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> When flushed, they fly to a bush or fence, or may drop back into the grass.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERising1996_12-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERising1996-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="#CITEREFSchnase1984">Schnase (1984</a>) reported that foraging occurred in a slow, methodical manner. Foliage gleaning from within mesquite (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopis" title="Prosopis">Prosopis</a></i> spp.) and other shrubs was only prominent after nestlings and fledglings were present. Fledglings apparently acquired most of their food in this manner rather than on the ground.
Cassin's Sparrow can commonly be found in brushy grassland and is nomadic.<sup id="cite_ref-North_11-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-North-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Between 1955 and 1989, there was a below average amount of this species although the number rises and falls each year.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> The sparrow can be found in south-central states.

The bird's nest is in grass and is a mixture of various weeds and grasses. The female lays from to 3 to 5 eggs.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERising1996_12-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERising1996-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
Although Cassin's Sparrows use slightly different habitats in different parts of their range, the common denominator across all habitats seems to be that they require both a grass component (usually short grass) and a shrub component. The latter component may be actual shrub species [e.g., mesquite, sage (<i>Artemisia</i> spp.), hackberry (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtis" title="Celtis">Celtis</a></i> spp.), rabbitbrush (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysothamnus" title="Chrysothamnus">Chrysothamnus</a></i> spp.), or oaks (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus" title="Quercus" class="mw-redirect">Quercus</a></i> spp.)] or other vegetative forms that approximate shrub structure [e.g. yucca (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca" title="Yucca">Yucca</a></i> spp.), paddle cacti (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia" title="Opuntia">Opuntia</a></i> spp.), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocotillo" title="Ocotillo" class="mw-redirect">ocotillo</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunch_grass" title="Bunch grass" class="mw-redirect">bunch grasses</a>].<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> The need for the structure provided by shrubs or similar plants is related to the bird's need for perches from which to sing or launch itself for its flight song and its frequent use of low shrubs for nest placement. <a href="#CITEREFSchnase1984">Schnase (1984</a>) also noted that the mesquite thickets within Cassin's Sparrow territories were distinctly preferred when fledglings were present. It appears that relative proportions of grass and shrubs in acceptable Cassin's Sparrow habitat cover a wide range from grassland habitats with a very sparse distribution of shrubs to shrubland habitats with a grass cover.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup>
