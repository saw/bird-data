The Scarlet Macaw (<i>Ara Macao</i> Linnaeus 1758) is a member of the genus <i>Ara</i> (Lacepede, 1799), one of 6 genera of Central and South American macaws. Carolus Linnaeus described and named the Scarlet Macaw in his Systemae Naturae in 1758. Protonym: <i>Psittacus macao</i>.
Two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> present differing widths in their yellow wing band:
The Central American scarlet macaw is larger and has blue on its wings instead of green.
It is about 81 centimetres (32&nbsp;in) long, of which more than half is the pointed, graduated tail typical of all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaw" title="Macaw">macaws</a>, though the Scarlet Macaw has a larger percentage of tail than the other large Macaws. The average weight is about 1 kilogram (2.2&nbsp;lb). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> is mostly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_(color)" title="Scarlet (color)">scarlet</a>, but the rump and tail-covert <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">feathers</a> are light blue, the greater upper wing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_covert" title="Wing covert" class="mw-redirect">coverts</a> are yellow, the upper sides of the flight feathers of the wings are dark blue as are the ends of the tail feathers, and the undersides of the wing and tail <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">flight feathers</a> are dark red with metallic gold iridescence. Some individuals may have green in the wings.
There is bare white skin around the eye and from there to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a>. Tiny white feathers are contained on the face patch. The upper mandible is mostly pale horn in color and the lower is black. Juveniles have dark eyes; adults have light yellow eyes.
It is frequently confused with the slightly larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green-winged_Macaw" title="Green-winged Macaw" class="mw-redirect">Green-winged Macaw</a>, which has more distinct red lines in the face and no yellow in the wing.
Scarlet Macaws make very loud, high and sometimes low-pitched, throaty squawks, squeaks and screams designed to carry many miles to call for their groups.
The Scarlet Macaw can live up to 75 years in captivity, although a more typical lifespan is 40 to 50 years.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
A typical sighting is of a single bird or a pair flying above the forest canopy, though in some areas flocks can be seen. They may gather at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_lick" title="Clay lick" class="mw-redirect">clay licks</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Scarlet Macaws eat mostly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a>, nuts and seeds, including large, hard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a>.
Scarlet Macaws mate for life. The hen lays two or three white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a> in a tree cavity. The female <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubates</a> the eggs for about five weeks, and the chicks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> about 90 days after hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-DA_2003_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DA_2003-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> and leave their parents about a year later. Juveniles reach sexual maturity at five years of age.
The South American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)" title="Range (biology)">range</a> is extensive and covers the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_basin" title="Amazon basin" class="mw-redirect">Amazon basin</a>; extending to Peru east of the Andes, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-juniper1998_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-juniper1998-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a> of Scarlet Macaws is considered to have the greatest latitudinal range for any bird in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i>Ara</i>, as the estimated maximum territorial range covers 6,700,000&nbsp;km². Nevertheless, the Scarlet Macaw’s habitat is fragmented, and the bird is mostly confined to tiny populations scattered throughout its original range in Middle America.<sup id="cite_ref-juniper1998_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-juniper1998-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> However, as they still occur in large numbers over most of their original range in South America, the species is classified by IUCN as "Least Concern".<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
It is listed on CITES Appendix 1 due to predation for the pet and cage bird trade.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Both subspecies are listed by USFWS as endangered.
