The <b>Common Greenshank</b> (<i>Tringa nebularia</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">wader</a> in the large family Scolopacidae, the typical waders. Its closest relative is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Yellowlegs" title="Greater Yellowlegs">Greater Yellowlegs</a>, which together with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_Redshank" title="Spotted Redshank">Spotted Redshank</a> form a close-knit group. Among them, these three species show all the basic leg and foot colours found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tringa" title="Tringa">shanks</a>, demonstrating that this character is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyletic" title="Paraphyletic" class="mw-redirect">paraphyletic</a> (Pereira &amp; Baker, 2005). They are also the largest shanks apart from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willet" title="Willet">Willet</a>, which is altogether more robustly built. The Greater Yellowlegs and the Common Greenshank share a coarse, dark, and fairly crisp breast pattern as well as much black on the shoulders and back in breeding plumage.
This is a subarctic bird, breeding from northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> eastwards across northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> species, wintering in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Subcontinent" title="Indian Subcontinent" class="mw-redirect">Indian Subcontinent</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia" title="Australasia">Australasia</a>, usually on fresh water. It breeds on dry ground near marshy areas, laying about four eggs in a ground scrape.
Common Greenshanks are brown in breeding plumage, and grey-brown in winter. When in water, they can appear very similar to Marsh Sandpipers but are distinguished by the shape of the lower bill which gives it an upturned appearance to the bill. They have long greenish legs and a long bill with a grey base. They show a white wedge on the back in flight. They are somewhat larger than the related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Redshank" title="Common Redshank">Common Redshank</a>. The usual call is a rapid series of three short fluty notes syllabilized as <i>teu-teu-teu</i>.
Like most waders, they feed on small invertebrates, but will also take small fish.
The Common Greenshank is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEWA" title="AEWA" class="mw-redirect">AEWA</a>) applies.
