The Slaty-backed Gull is the fourth largest species of gull in the world. It is considered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific" title="North Pacific" class="mw-redirect">North Pacific</a> equivalent of the largest gull species, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Black-backed_Gull" title="Great Black-backed Gull">Great Black-backed Gull</a>. measuring 55–68.5 cm (22–27.0 in) in length, 132–160 cm (52–63 in) in wingspan and weighing 1.05–1.7 kg (2.3–3.7 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Olsen_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Olsen-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 40.6 to 48 cm (16.0 to 19 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 4.8 to 6.5 cm (1.9 to 2.6 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 6 to 7.6 cm (2.4 to 3.0 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Olsen_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Olsen-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> It has a white head, belly, and tail with a dark slaty-gray back and wings with a broad white trailing edge. The wings and back are slightly darker than those of the Western Gull.

The legs are pink and short when compared with those of similar-looking gulls, and the body appears more stout. The bill is yellow with orange-red subterminal spot. Immature gulls' plumage is brown, similar to the that of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Black-backed_Gull" title="Great Black-backed Gull">Great Black-backed Gull</a>, but paler, and is practically indistinguishable from the immature <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herring_Gull" title="Herring Gull">Herring Gull</a><sup class="plainlinks noprint Inline-Template" style="vertical-align: text-top; white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="//toolserver.org/%7Edispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py?page=Slaty-backed_Gull&amp;editintro=Template:Disambiguation_needed/editintro&amp;client=Template:Dn"><span title="Link needs disambiguation from June 2011">disambiguation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> in the field.
Like other gulls, the Slaty-backed Gull is both a forager and a scavenger.
