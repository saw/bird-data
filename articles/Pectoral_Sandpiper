The <b>Pectoral Sandpiper</b> (<i>Calidris melanotos</i>) is a small, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">wader</a> that breeds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintering" title="Wintering" class="mw-redirect">wintering</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania" title="Oceania">Oceania</a>. It eats small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a>. Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a>, a hole scraped in the ground and with a thick lining, is deep enough to protect its four <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> from the cool breezes of its breeding grounds. The pectoral sandpiper is 21&nbsp;cm long, with a wingspan of 46&nbsp;cm.
The Pectoral Sandpiper is sometimes separated with the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stint" title="Stint">stint</a>" sandpipers in <i>Erolia</i>. This may or may not represent a good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophyletic" title="Monophyletic" class="mw-redirect">monophyletic</a> group, depending on the placement of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic" title="Phylogenetic" class="mw-redirect">phylogenetically</a> enigmatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curlew_Sandpiper" title="Curlew Sandpiper">Curlew Sandpiper</a> (<i>"C." ferruginea</i>), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species" title="Type species">type species</a> of <i>Erolia</i>. In any case, the genus name <i>Ereunetes</i>—formerly used for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sandpiper" title="Western Sandpiper">Western Sandpiper</a> (<i>"C." mauri</i>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipalmated_Sandpiper" title="Semipalmated Sandpiper">Semipalmated Sandpiper</a> (<i>"C." pusilla</i>), which are also members of the stint <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade" title="Clade">clade</a>—was established before <i>Erolia</i>.
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%27s_Sandpiper" title="Cox's Sandpiper">Cox's Sandpiper</a>" (<i>"Calidris"</i> × <i>paramelanotos</i>) is a stereotyped <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybrid</a> between this species and the Curlew Sandpiper. This does not prove a particularly close relationship between these two species, as far more distantly related waders <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridisation_in_shorebirds" title="Hybridisation in shorebirds">have successfully hybridized</a>. In any case, among the stint clade the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-necked_Stint" title="Red-necked Stint">Red-necked Stint</a> (<i>"C." ruficollis</i>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-toed_Stint" title="Long-toed Stint">Long-toed Stint</a> (<i>"C." subminuta</i>) are particularly close relatives of the Pectoral Sandpiper.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
This bird looks similar to the widely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatric" title="Sympatric" class="mw-redirect">sympatric</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp-tailed_Sandpiper" title="Sharp-tailed Sandpiper">Sharp-tailed Sandpiper</a> (<i>"C." acuminata</i>), which is not a member of the stint clade however. The Pectoral Sandpiper is a largish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calidrid" title="Calidrid">calidrid</a> (21&nbsp;cm in length, with a wingspan of 46&nbsp;cm)<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> with a grey-brown back, brownest in the summer male, and greyest in winter. The Pectoral Sandpiper has a grey breast, sharply demarcated at its lower edge, which gives this species its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> name; this clear dividing line is particularly conspicuous if the birds are turned towards the observer. The legs are yellowish, and the bill is olive with a darker tip.
The juveniles are more brightly patterned above with rufous colouration and white mantle stripes.
This species differs from the Sharp-tailed Sandpiper in its breast pattern, weaker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercilium" title="Supercilium">supercilium</a> and greyer crown.
It is a very long-distance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrant</a>, and about half of the species breeds in the boggy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a> of northeast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, the rest nesting in a range from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> to central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The American and most of the Asian birds winter in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, but some Asian breeders winter in southern and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. On migration and in winter, the Pectoral Sandpiper is typically found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater" title="Freshwater" class="mw-redirect">freshwater</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitats</a>.
This species also occurs as a regular migrant to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and is seen most years in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-NBotWM_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NBotWM-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> While the Pectoral Sandpiper has not been recorded as breeding species in Europe, vagrant individuals were found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> in suitable breeding habitat during summer.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Many of the birds occurring in Western Europe may be on a regular migration from Asian breeding grounds to winter in Southern Africa.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> September 2003 saw a record influx to those two countries, with 40 found in Ireland and 150 in Great Britain. On the US Pacific coast, such stagings of migrant flocks appear to be rarer.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Vagrant individuals are sometimes seen elsewhere off the usual migration routes, e.g. on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianas" title="Marianas" class="mw-redirect">Marianas</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Islands" title="Marshall Islands">Marshall Islands</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palau" title="Palau">Palau</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronesia" title="Micronesia">Micronesia</a>; they are somewhat more frequently encountered on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands" title="Hawaiian Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>.
The Pectoral Sandpiper's migration might be affected by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, as is suspected for many Arctic-breeding birds: 100 years ago, migrating Pectoral Sandpipers were observed to pass through northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> in early-mid May and again in late August; today, the bulk of the northward migration takes place in April already, and most birds do not return until mid-September.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
These birds forage on grasslands and mudflats, picking up food by sight, sometimes by probing. They mainly eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a> and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a>. The male has a courtship display which involves puffing up his breast, which has a fat sac in the breeding season to enhance his performance.
The Pectoral Sandpiper builds a steep-sided <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">scrape nest</a> with a considerable volume of lining material. The nest is deep enough that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> sit about 3&nbsp;cm (1.2&nbsp;in) below ground level, which helps to minimize heat loss from the cool breezes which occur at the latitudes where the species nests.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> The female lays four eggs.
