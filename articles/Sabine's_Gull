The <b>Sabine's Gull</b> <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gull</a>. Its generic placement is disputed; some authors treat it as the sole species in the genus <i>Xema</i> as <i><b>Xema sabini</b></i>,<sup id="cite_ref-hbw_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> while others retain it in the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larus" title="Larus">Larus</a></i> as <i><b>Larus sabini</b></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-bwp_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bwp-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ebcc_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ebcc-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> It breeds in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">arctic</a> and has a circumpolar distribution through northernmost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>.

This species is easy to identify through its striking wing pattern. The adult has a pale grey back and wing coverts, black primary flight feathers and white secondaries. The white tail is forked. The male's hood darkens during breeding season. Their bills are black with a yellow tip. Young birds have a similar tricoloured wing pattern, but the grey is replaced by brown, and the tail has a black terminal band. The juveniles take two years to attain full adult plumage. They have a very high-pitched and squeaking call.<sup id="cite_ref-bwp_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bwp-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Sabine's Gull breeds in colonies on coasts and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a>, laying two or three spotted olive-brown eggs in a ground nest lined with grass. It is very pelagic outside the breeding season. It takes a wide variety of mainly animal food, and will eat any suitable small prey. It also steals eggs from nesting colonies of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Tern" title="Arctic Tern">Arctic Terns</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The specific epithet and common name honour the Irish scientist Sir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Sabine" title="Edward Sabine">Edward Sabine</a>, who had sent a specimen to his brother <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Sabine" title="Joseph Sabine">Joseph Sabine</a>; the first description was in 1819.
The Sabine's Gull is usually treated as comprising a monotypic genus, it is only placed within the genus <i>Larus</i> when the genus is enlarged. The black bill and notched tail is almost unique within the gulls, characteristics shared only with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow-tailed_Gull" title="Swallow-tailed Gull">Swallow-tailed Gull</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galapagos" title="Galapagos" class="mw-redirect">Galapagos</a>. On the basis of this the two species were often thought to be each other's closest relatives, a hypothesis ruled out by a number of behaviour and ecological differences. Mitochondrial DNA studies confirmed this, and the closest relative of the Sabine's Gull is now thought to be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Gull" title="Ivory Gull">Ivory Gull</a>, another Arctic species. The two species are thought to have separated a long time ago, around 2 million years ago.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
