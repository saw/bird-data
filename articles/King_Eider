The <b>King Eider</b> (<i>Somateria spectabilis</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merginae" title="Merginae">sea duck</a> that breeds along Northern Hemisphere Arctic coasts of northeast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. The birds spend most of the year in coastal marine ecosystems at high latitudes, and migrate to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a> to breed in June and July. They lay four to seven eggs in a scrape on the ground lined with grass and down.
The King Eider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">winters</a> in arctic and subarctic marine areas, most notably in the Bering Sea, the west coast of Greenland, eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a>. It also occurs annually off the northeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamchatka_Peninsula" title="Kamchatka Peninsula">Kamchatka</a>. Breeding areas include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_coastal_tundra" title="Arctic coastal tundra">Arctic coastal tundra</a> of the north coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>. This species dives for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benthic_zone" title="Benthic zone">benthic</a> invertebrates, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychaete" title="Polychaete">polychaete</a> worms, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusc" title="Mollusc" class="mw-redirect">molluscs</a>, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussel" title="Mussel">mussels</a> being a favoured food. Wintering birds can form large flocks on suitable coastal waters, with some flocks exceeding 100,000 birds.
This species is smaller than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Eider" title="Common Eider">Common Eider</a>. The male is unmistakable with its black body, white breast and multicoloured head. The drake's call is a deep cooing.
The female (occasionally colloquially referred to as a "Queen Eider"<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>) is a brown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a>, but can still be readily distinguished from all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck" title="Duck">ducks</a> except other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eider" title="Eider">eider</a> species on size and structure. The head is shorter than in the Common Eider, and the feathering extension onto the bill is rounded, not triangular in shape.
An immature drake is typically all dark with a white breast and a yellow bill patch. Eclipse adult drakes are similar but lack the white breast.
The King Eider is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEWA" title="AEWA" class="mw-redirect">AEWA</a>) applies.
The King Eider, or <i>Qengallek</i>, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yup%27ik" title="Yup'ik" class="mw-redirect">Yup'ik</a> is a regular source of fresh meat in the spring. They begin their migration past the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon-Kuskokwim_Delta" title="Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta" class="mw-redirect">Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta</a> in late April and are hunted in great numbers. In May, several hundred thousand King Eiders pass Point Barrow in northern Alaska on their way to Alaskan and Canadian breeding grounds.
