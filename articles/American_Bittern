The <b>American Bittern</b> (<i>Botaurus lentiginosus</i><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>) is a wading bird of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron" title="Heron">heron</a> family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardeidae" title="Ardeidae" class="mw-redirect">Ardeidae</a>. New evidence has led the American Ornithologists' Union to move the heron family into the order Pelecaniformes (from Ciconiiformes).
It is a large, chunky, brown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a>, very similar to the Eurasian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Bittern" title="Great Bittern" class="mw-redirect">Great Bittern</a> (<i>Botaurus stellaris</i>), though slightly smaller. It is 58–85 cm (23–33 in) in length, with a 92–115 cm (36–45 in) wingspan and a body mass of 370–1,072 g (0.82–2.36 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CRC_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Although common in much of its range, the American Bittern is usually well-hidden in bogs, marshes and wet meadows. Usually solitary, it walks stealthily among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typha" title="Typha">cattails</a> or <a href="/w/index.php?title=Schoenoplectu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Schoenoplectu (page does not exist)">bulrushes</a>. If it senses that it has been seen, the American Bittern becomes motionless, with its bill pointed upward, causing it to blend into the reeds. It is most active at dusk. More often heard than seen, this bittern has a call that resembles a congested pump.
Like other members of the heron family, the American Bittern feeds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a> and shallow ponds, dining on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibians" title="Amphibians" class="mw-redirect">amphibians</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile" title="Reptile">reptiles</a>.
This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittern" title="Bittern">bittern</a> winters in the southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>. It summers throughout <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and much of the United States. As a long-distance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrant</a>, it is a very rare vagrant in Europe, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. This bird nests in isolated places with the female building the nest and the male guarding it. Two or three eggs are incubated by the female for 29 days, and the chicks leave after 6–7 weeks.
No <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> are accepted today. However, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil" title="Fossil">fossils</a> found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichetucknee_River" title="Ichetucknee River">Ichetucknee River</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>, and originally described as a new form of heron (<i>Palaeophoyx columbiana</i>; McCoy, 1963) were later recognized to be a smaller, prehistoric subspecies of the American Bittern which lived during the Late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene" title="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> (Olson, 1974) and would thus be called <i>B. l. columbianus</i>.
This bird's numbers are declining in many parts of its range due to habitat loss.
Many of the folk names<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> are given for its distinctive call made by inhaling and exhaling large quantities of air; E. Choate<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> lists "Bogbumper" and "Stake Driver". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_History_(Pliny)" title="Natural History (Pliny)">Pliny</a> likened the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Bittern" title="Eurasian Bittern">old-world bittern</a>'s call to the roaring of a bull, <i>"boatum tauri"</i>, whence the generic name Botaurus.
To the Cajuns of South Louisiana this bird was known as a "Grobek", and was previously hunted for food, being considered a delicacy.
The American Bittern (<i>Botaurus lentiginosus</i>) is protected under the United States <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act_of_1918" title="Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a>. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/intrnltr/mbta/mbtandx.html">[2]</a> It is also protected under the Canadian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Birds_Convention_Act" title="Migratory Birds Convention Act">Migratory Birds Convention Act</a> of 1994.
