The <b>Iceland Gull</b> (<i>Larus glaucoides</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gull</a> which breeds in the Arctic regions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>, but not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, where it is only seen in the winter. It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering from in the North <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> as far south as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> and northernmost states of the eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">USA</a>, as well as in the interior of North America as far W as the western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>. It is much scarcer in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> than the similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucous_Gull" title="Glaucous Gull">Glaucous Gull</a>.

This species breeds colonially or singly on coasts and cliffs, making a nest lined with grass, moss or seaweed on the ground or cliff. Normally, 2-3 light brown eggs are laid.
The nominate subspecies, <i>glaucoides</i>, is very pale in all plumages, with absolutely no melanin in the tips of the primaries in adult plumage. Adults are pale grey above, with a yellowish-green bill. Immatures are very pale grey; the bill is more extensively dark than with Glaucous Gull, and lacks pink.
The Iceland Gull is a largish gull, although relatively slender and light-weight. In length, it can measure from 50 to 64 cm (20 to 25 in), wingspan is from 115 to 150 cm (45 to 59 in) and weight is from 480 to 1,100 g (1.1 to 2.4 lb). Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 37.9 to 44.3 cm (14.9 to 17.4 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 3.6 to 5.4 cm (1.4 to 2.1 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 4.9 to 6.7 cm (1.9 to 2.6 in).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Harrison_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrison-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CRC_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> It is smaller and thinner billed than the very large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucous_Gull" title="Glaucous Gull">Glaucous Gull</a>, and is usually smaller than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herring_Gull" title="Herring Gull">Herring Gull</a>.

These are omnivores like most <i>Larus</i> gulls, eating fish, molluscs, offal, scraps and eggs. These birds forage while flying, picking up food at or just below the water's surface, also feeds while walking or swimming. Their scavenging habits lead them to frequent garbage dumps, sewage outlets and places where fish are cleaned.
