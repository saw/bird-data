The <b>Bald Eagle</b> (<i>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</i> Greek hali = salt, aeetus = eagle, leuco = white, cephalis = head) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">bird of prey</a> found in North America. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_eagle" title="Sea eagle">sea eagle</a>, it has two known sub-species and forms a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_species_complex" title="Cryptic species complex">species pair</a> with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-tailed_Eagle" title="White-tailed Eagle">White-tailed Eagle</a>. Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States" title="Contiguous United States">contiguous United States</a>, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.
The Bald Eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>, which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> of any North American bird, up to 4 meters (13&nbsp;ft) deep, 2.5 meters (8.2&nbsp;ft) wide, and one&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_ton" title="Metric ton" class="mw-redirect">metric ton</a> (1.1&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_ton" title="Short ton">tons</a>) in weight,<sup id="cite_ref-hbw_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> and reaches sexual maturity at four years or five years of age.
Bald Eagles are not actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald" title="Bald" class="mw-redirect">bald</a>; the name derives from an older meaning of "white headed". The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a>, but females are larger than males. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">beak</a> is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.
The Bald Eagle is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_birds" title="List of national birds">national bird</a> of the United States of America and appears on its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States" title="Great Seal of the United States">Seal</a>. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction" title="Local extinction">extirpation</a> in the continental United States. Populations recovered and the species was removed from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="Federal government of the United States">U.S. federal government's</a> list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species" title="Endangered species">endangered species</a> on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_species" title="Threatened species">threatened species</a>.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> of an adult Bald Eagle is evenly brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> is evident in the species in that females are 25 percent larger than males.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The beak, feet and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" title="Iris (anatomy)">irides</a> are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">beak</a> is large and hooked, with a yellow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cere" title="Cere" class="mw-redirect">cere</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Bald Eagle forms a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_pair" title="Species pair" class="mw-redirect">species pair</a> with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasian</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-tailed_Eagle" title="White-tailed Eagle">White-tailed Eagle</a>. This species pair consists of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the White-tailed Eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The pair diverged from other Sea Eagles at the beginning of the Early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene" title="Miocene">Miocene</a> (c. 10&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_(unit)" title="Ma (unit)" class="mw-redirect">Ma BP</a>) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene" title="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>, 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> The two species probably diverged in the North <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a>, as the White-tailed Eagle spread westwards into Eurasia and the Bald Eagle spread eastwards into North America.<sup id="cite_ref-Habitat_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Habitat-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Bald Eagle prefers habitats near seacoasts, rivers, large lakes, oceans, and other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish. Studies have shown a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than 11&nbsp;km (7&nbsp;mi), and lakes with an area greater than 10 square kilometers (4&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) are optimal for breeding Bald Eagles.<sup id="cite_ref-Gov_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gov-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Bald Eagle requires old-growth and mature stands of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinophyta" title="Pinophyta">coniferous</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardwood" title="Hardwood">hardwood</a> trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Selected trees must have good visibility, an open structure, and proximity to prey, but the height or species of tree is not as important as an abundance of comparatively large trees surrounding the body of water. Forests used for nesting should have a canopy cover of no more than 60 percent, and no less than 20 percent, and be in close proximity to water.<sup id="cite_ref-Gov_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gov-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Bald Eagle is extremely sensitive to human activity, and is found most commonly in areas free of human disturbance. It chooses sites more than 1.2&nbsp;km (0.75&nbsp;mi) from low-density human disturbance and more than 1.8&nbsp;km (1.1&nbsp;mi) from medium- to high-density human disturbance.<sup id="cite_ref-Gov_21-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gov-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> Occasionally Bald Eagles will venture into large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities, such as Hardtack Island on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_River" title="Willamette River">Willamette River</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon" title="Portland, Oregon">Portland</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon" title="Oregon">Oregon</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Heinz_National_Wildlife_Refuge_at_Tinicum" title="John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum">John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> Despite this sensitivity, a family of Bald Eagles moved to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem" title="Harlem">Harlem</a> neighborhood in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> in 2010.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Bald Eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, all of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_United_States" title="Continental United States" class="mw-redirect">continental United States</a>, and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.

At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleutian_Islands" title="Aleutian Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>, northern and eastern Canada, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Bull87_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bull87-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup>
Bald Eagles will also congregate in certain locations in winter. From November until February, one to two thousand birds winter in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamish,_British_Columbia" title="Squamish, British Columbia">Squamish, British Columbia</a>, about halfway between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler,_British_Columbia" title="Whistler, British Columbia">Whistler</a>.

It has occurred as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrancy_(biology)" title="Vagrancy (biology)">vagrant</a> twice in Ireland; a juvenile was shot illegally in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermanagh" title="Fermanagh" class="mw-redirect">Fermanagh</a> on January 11, 1973 (misidentified at first as a White-tailed Eagle), and an exhausted juvenile was captured in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kerry" title="County Kerry">Kerry</a> on November 15, 1987.
The Bald Eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal" title="Thermal">thermal convection currents</a>. It reaches speeds of 56–70 kilometers per hour (35–43 mph) when gliding and flapping, and about 48 kilometers per hour (30&nbsp;mph) while carrying fish.<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> Its dive speed is between 120–160 kilometers per hour (75–99 mph), though it seldom dives vertically.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of populations are subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, for example, will disperse northwards in the summer.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> The Bald Eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal" title="Thermal">thermals</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Updraft" title="Updraft" class="mw-redirect">updrafts</a>, and food resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, when thermals are produced by the sun.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>

Bald Eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age. When they are old enough to breed, they often return to the area where they were born. It is thought that Bald Eagles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_for_life" title="Mate for life" class="mw-redirect">mate for life</a>. However, if one member of a pair dies or disappears, the other will choose a new mate.

When breeding where there are no trees, the Bald Eagle will nest on the ground. Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year, but it is rare for all three chicks to successfully fly. Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs. The other parent will hunt for food or look for nesting material. The eggs average about 73 millimeters (2.9&nbsp;in) long and have a breadth of 55 millimeters (2.2&nbsp;in).<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_27-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup>

Once a common sight in much of the continent, the Bald Eagle was severely affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">DDT</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49"><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup> Bald Eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomagnification" title="Biomagnification">biomagnification</a>. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium" title="Calcium">calcium</a> metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch.<sup id="cite_ref-Bull87_25-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bull87-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the Bald Eagle population was 300,000–500,000,<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50"><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States" title="Contiguous United States">contiguous states</a> of the US. Other factors in Bald Eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, as well as both legal and illegal shooting. In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that in the state of Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70,000 Bald Eagles had been shot. Many of the hunters killed the Bald Eagles under the long-held mistaken beliefs that Bald Eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with their talons.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51"><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup> Later illegal shooting was described as "the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles," according to a 1978 report in the Endangered Species Technical Bulletin. In 1984, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wildlife_Federation" title="National Wildlife Federation">National Wildlife Federation</a> listed hunting, power-line electrocution, and collisions in flight as the leading causes of eagle deaths. Bald Eagle populations have also been negatively affected by oil, lead, and mercury pollution, and by human and predator intrusion.<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52"><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup>
The species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act_of_1918" title="Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918">1918 Migratory Bird Treaty</a>, later extended to all of North America. The 1940 Bald Eagle Protection Act in the U.S., which protected the Bald Eagle and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Eagle" title="Golden Eagle">Golden Eagle</a>, prohibited commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The Bald Eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Also in 1972, DDT was banned in the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup>
With regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The Bald Eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000–115,000 by 1992;<sup id="cite_ref-hbw_2-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state" title="U.S. state">U.S. state</a> with the largest resident population is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, with about 40,000–50,000, with the next highest population the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada" title="Provinces and territories of Canada">Canadian province</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> with 20,000–30,000 in 1992.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw_2-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License" title="License">Permits</a> are required to keep Bald Eagles in captivity in the United States. Permits are primarily issued to public educational institutions, and the eagles which they show are permanently injured individuals which cannot be released to the wild. The facilities where eagles are kept must be equipped with adequate caging and facilities, as well as workers experienced in the handling and care of eagles. Bald Eagles cannot legally be kept for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry" title="Falconry">falconry</a> in the United States. As a rule, the Bald Eagle is a poor choice for public shows, being timid, prone to becoming highly stressed, and unpredictable in nature. Native American Tribes can obtain a "Native American Religious Use" permit to keep non-releasable eagles as well. They use their naturally molted feathers for religious and cultural ceremonies. The Bald Eagle can be long-lived in captivity if well cared for, but does not breed well even under the best conditions.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56"><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> In Canada, a license is required to keep Bald Eagles for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry" title="Falconry">falconry</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57"><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup>
