<i>Elanus caeruleus leucurus</i>
The <b>White-tailed Kite</b> (<i><b>Elanus leucurus</b></i>) is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elanid_kite" title="Elanid kite">elanid kite</a> of genus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elanus" title="Elanus">Elanus</a> found in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>.
Their coloration is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gull</a>-like, but their shape and flight falcon-like, with a rounded tail. Mainly white underneath, they have black wingtips and shoulders. A mid-sized kite, it measures 35–43 cm (14–17 in) in length, spans 88–102 cm (35–40 in) across the wings and weighs 250–380 g (8.8–13 oz). Both the wings, at 29–32.8 cm (11–12.9 in) each, and the tail, at 15.1–18.6 cm (5.9–7.3 in), are relatively elongated. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> measures around 3.6&nbsp;cm (1.4&nbsp;in).<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
For some recent decades, it united with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-winged_Kite" title="Black-winged Kite">Black-winged Kite</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> in <i>Elanus caeruleus</i>, and collectively called <b>"Black-shouldered Kite"</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> More recently it was argued that the White-tailed Kite differed from the Old World species in size, shape, plumage, and behavior, and that these differences were sufficient to warrant specific status.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> This argument was accepted by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a>, so the White-tailed Kite has its original name back. Meanwhile, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World" title="Old World">Old World</a> <i>E. caeruleus</i> is again called Black-winged Kite, while the name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-shouldered_Kite" title="Black-shouldered Kite">Black-shouldered Kite</a> is now reserved for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australian</a> species, <i>Elanus axillaris</i>, which had also been lumped into <i>E. caeruleus</i> but now regarded as separate again.
The White-tailed Kite was rendered almost extinct in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> in the 1930s and 1940s by shooting and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg-collecting" title="Egg-collecting" class="mw-redirect">egg-collecting</a>, but they are now common again. Their distribution is patchy, however – they can be seen in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Valley_(California)" title="Central Valley (California)">Central Valley</a> and southern coastal areas, open land around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goleta,_California" title="Goleta, California">Goleta</a> including the Ellwood Mesa Open Space, and also around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay" title="San Francisco Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>, but elsewhere they are still rare or absent. They are also found in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California_peninsula" title="Baja California peninsula">Baja California peninsula</a>, and in eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, and on a global scale they are not considered threatened species by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> On rare occasions the bird can be found far afield. At different times, two had been sighted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a> as of 2010.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
White-tailed Kites feed principally on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent" title="Rodent">rodents</a>, and they are readily seen patrolling or hovering over lowland scrub or grassland. They rarely if ever eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a>, and even in open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerrado" title="Cerrado">cerrado</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-species_feeding_flock" title="Mixed-species feeding flock" class="mw-redirect">mixed-species feeding flocks</a> will generally ignore them.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Outside the breeding season they roost communally in groups of up to 100.
