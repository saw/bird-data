The <b>Black Guillemot</b> or <b>Tystie</b> (<i>Cepphus grylle</i>) is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcidae" title="Alcidae" class="mw-redirect">alcid</a>.
Adult birds have black bodies with a white wing patch, a thin dark bill, and red legs and feet. They show white wing linings in flight. In winter, the upperparts are pale grey and the underparts are white. The wings remain black with the large white patch on the inner wing. They are 32–38&nbsp;cm in length, and with a 49–58&nbsp;cm wingspan.
Their breeding habitat is rocky shores, cliffs and islands on northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> coasts in eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine" title="Maine">Maine</a>, and in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>.They are one of the few birds to breed on Surtsey, Iceland a new volcanic island. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> it is fairly common breeding bird in western and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.

These birds often overwinter in their breeding areas, moving to open waters if necessary, but usually not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrating</a> very far south.
