The White-flanked Antwren is found throughout the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Basin" title="Amazon Basin">Amazon Basin</a> as well as to the southeast in the adjacent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocantins_River" title="Tocantins River">Tocantins-</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araguaia_River" title="Araguaia River">Araguaia River</a> drainage, and then in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunct_distribution" title="Disjunct distribution">disjunct</a> groups on the southeast coast of Brazil; it also ranges through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyanas" title="Guyanas" class="mw-redirect">Guyanas</a> on the northeast of South America to Pacific and Caribbean coastal regions of Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela; also, the entire eastern Venezuela <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orinoco_River" title="Orinoco River" class="mw-redirect">Orinoco River</a> grouping is part of the northern Amazon range.

The White-flanked Antwren is typically 10.7&nbsp;cm long, and weighs 8.1 g. The adult male has dark grey upperparts, black underparts, and black wings with bars of white spots. The flanks and underwings are white. The female and immature male have brown upperparts, yellowish-buff underparts and weakly barred rufous wings. Her flanks and underwings are white, much like the male.
Males of the distinctive western race <i>M. a. melaena</i> have black upperparts and underparts, and the female is darker than nominate <i>M. a. axillaris</i>.
This is a common and confiding bird of primary and second growth forest, usually found in small groups. The female lays two purple-marked white eggs, which are incubated by both sexes for 16 days to hatching, in a small plant fibre and dead leaf cup nest low in a tree or shrub.
The White-flanked Antwren feeds on small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a> taken from twigs and foliage in the lower branches of trees. It has a <i>queep</i> whistle followed by a trilled <i>trrrrrr</i>. <i>M. a. melaena</i> has a two note call, <i>naa-who</i> and a whistled descending <i>pee pee pee-pee-pee-pee-pee-puu-puu</i> call. Given the differences in plumage and vocalisations, the two forms may possibly be different species.
