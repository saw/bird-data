The <b>Bicoloured Hawk</b> (<i>Accipiter bicolor</i>) is a species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">bird of prey</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipitridae" title="Accipitridae">Accipitridae</a> family. It is found in forest, woodland, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_growth" title="Second growth" class="mw-redirect">second growth</a>, plantations, and wooded savanna in southeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, and northern and central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> (as far south as northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-NeotropicalBirds_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NeotropicalBirds-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Though generally uncommon, it is the most common species of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter" title="Accipiter">Accipiter</a></i> in most of its range, but it does not occur at altitudes above 2,700 metres (8,900&nbsp;ft) such as the highest parts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
At 34–45 centimetres (13–18 in) in length and 200–450 grams (7.1–16 oz) in weight, it is significantly smaller than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Goshawk" title="Northern Goshawk">Northern Goshawk</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and North America, and somewhat smaller than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper%27s_Hawk" title="Cooper's Hawk">Cooper's Hawk</a> of North America, but among the largest <i>Accipiter</i> hawks in Central and South America (only the rare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey-bellied_Hawk" title="Grey-bellied Hawk">Grey-bellied Hawk</a> is larger).<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> As in other <i>Accipiter</i> hawks, the female is far larger than the male. Adults are grey above with darker wings and crown, and a banded tail. The underparts typically vary from dark grey to very pale grey, but the southern subspecies can sometimes be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufescent" title="Rufescent" class="mw-redirect">rufescent</a> below. The thighs are always pure rufous (not always easily seen), and the underwing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_(feather)" title="Covert (feather)" class="mw-redirect">coverts</a> are white in the northern subspecies and rufous in the southern.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_(organism)" title="Juvenile (organism)">Juveniles</a> are very variable. They can be white, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buff_(colour)" title="Buff (colour)">buff</a> or rufous below, and sometimes with dark streaks. Their upperparts are browner than in adults, and the thighs are sometimes paler.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Bicoloured Hawk is a species in the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter" title="Accipiter">Accipiter</a></i> and is included in the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipitridae" title="Accipitridae">Accipitridae</a>. Three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> are currently recognized. The Bicoloured Hawk is also closely related to the Cooper’s Hawk (<i>A.&nbsp;cooperii</i>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundlach%27s_Hawk" title="Gundlach's Hawk">Gundlach's Hawk</a> (<i>A.&nbsp;gundlachi</i>); these three form a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superspecies" title="Superspecies">superspecies</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-BirdsWorld_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Until recently, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_Hawk" title="Chilean Hawk">Chilean Hawk</a> (<i>A.&nbsp;chilensis</i>) from the colder, southernmost South America was treated as a race of <i>A.&nbsp;bicolor</i> but due to its differences in habitat preferences and plumages from the Bicoloured Hawk, <i>A.&nbsp;chilensis</i> is now considered a full species.<sup id="cite_ref-GlobalRaptors_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GlobalRaptors-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Four subspecies of <i>A. bicolor</i> are acknowledged. These are:
The Bicoloured Hawk is widespread but uncommonly observed. Its range extends from Mexico to west Ecuador, the Guianas to Colombia, south to east Peru, through Amazonian Brazil to Paraguay, north-north western Argentina, Bolivia and to Chile.<sup id="cite_ref-GuideSAMBirds_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GuideSAMBirds-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> It mainly resides in forests, along forest edges and in clearings in tropical and locally subtropical zones,<sup id="cite_ref-ManualBirds_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ManualBirds-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> although its habitat is none too specialized. It may also reside in rain forest, drier, thinned forest, and palm savanna with gallery forest.<sup id="cite_ref-BirdsWorld_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Forest disturbance and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation" title="Habitat fragmentation">fragmentation</a> negatively affect the habitat and quantity of the Bicoloured Hawk, which is most abundant in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-growth_forest" title="Old-growth forest">primary undisturbed forest</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian_forest" title="Riparian forest">riparian forest</a>. There are fewer hawks in disturbed habitats such as forests that have been logged, and even fewer in those fragmented habitats that provide greater than 66% forest cover. These hawks are rarely present in forests that provide less than 66% forest cover.<sup id="cite_ref-Effects_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Effects-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Bicoloured Hawk is difficult to detect due to its shyness and inconspicuousness. Because of this behaviour, the Bicoloured Hawk may be more common than it seems.<sup id="cite_ref-Bombachinha_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bombachinha-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Its vocalisations are mainly subdued and unnoticeable. Males have been heard to give a soft, clear whistle and females can emit a loud "<i>cac cac cac</i>" when around the nest and young.<sup id="cite_ref-HawksWorld_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HawksWorld-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> A barking "<i>kra-kra-kra-kr-kr-kr-ka</i>" may also be heard from both sexes.<sup id="cite_ref-BirdsVenezuela_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdsVenezuela-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> During incubation, males give a sharp "<i>kek</i>" vocalisation upon arrival to the nest with food, to which the female replies with a nasal "<i>wreh</i>".<sup id="cite_ref-BreedingBiology_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BreedingBiology-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
These hawks capture prey in a stealthy manner by flying through dense vegetation to ambush unsuspecting prey. They may also capture prey through aerial pursuit after inconspicuously sitting and watching their target.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> At times, the Bicoloured Hawk may hunt in pairs. Most commonly, it feeds on smaller birds such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_thrush" title="True thrush">thrushes</a> and small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae" title="Columbidae">doves</a><sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> but has also been known to consume small mammals and reptiles.<sup id="cite_ref-BreedingBiology_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BreedingBiology-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Several instances where the hawks attack groups of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel_monkeys" title="Squirrel monkeys" class="mw-redirect">squirrel monkeys</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarins" title="Tamarins" class="mw-redirect">tamarins</a> have been witnessed. In addition, these hawks may instead follow groups of monkeys in order the feed on the insects that are exposed by the monkeys.<sup id="cite_ref-BirdsWorld_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Bicoloured Hawks breed in forest areas, choosing to build nests on tree branches and occasionally hanging vines. The nest is built in cooperation between the male and female and is constructed from dried sticks and leaves. Each breeding pair will normally build a new nest at the beginning of each breeding year. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copulation" title="Copulation" class="mw-redirect">Copulation</a> occurs after breeding activities such as feeding and nest building have been completed. Egg laying takes place approximately five weeks after copulation and the dull white eggs measure an average of 47.1&nbsp;mm × 36.5&nbsp;mm; clutches average 1–3&nbsp;eggs.<sup id="cite_ref-EggNotes_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-EggNotes-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> The eggs are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">brooded</a> for about three weeks by the female while the male forages for food. Bicoloured Hawk chicks are categorized as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" title="Altricial">semi-altrical</a>; the eyes are open at hatching but the chicks are not immediately mobile and are fed by the parents.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> around 30–36 days after hatching and the fledgling period spans nearly seven weeks, during which the young will return to the nest frequently for food until they become independent.<sup id="cite_ref-BreedingBiology_12-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BreedingBiology-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
