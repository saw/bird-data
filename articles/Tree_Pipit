<b>Tree Pipit</b>, <i>Anthus trivialis</i>, is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> which breeds across most of Europe and temperate western and central Asia. It is a long-distance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrant</a> moving in winter to Africa and southern Asia.
This is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipit" title="Pipit">pipit</a>, which resembles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadow_Pipit" title="Meadow Pipit">Meadow Pipit</a>. This is an undistinguished looking species, streaked brown above and with black markings on a white belly and buff breast below. It can be distinguished from the slightly smaller Meadow Pipit by its heavier bill and greater contrast between its buff breast and white belly. Tree Pipits more readily perch in trees.
The call is a strong <i>spek</i>. Unlike the weak call of its relative. The song flight is unmistakable. The bird rises a short distance up from a tree, and then parachutes down on stiff wings, the song becoming more drawn out towards the end.
The breeding habitat is open woodland and scrub. The nest is on the ground, with 4–8 eggs being laid. This species is insectivorous, like its relatives, but will also take seeds.
They have decreased in population by 85% in the last 20 years
They breed in habitats with a wooded component, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowland_heath" title="Lowland heath">Lowland heath</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppice" title="Coppice" class="mw-redirect">coppice</a>. They are found mostly in open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch" title="Birch">birch</a> woodland on the boundary with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorland" title="Moorland">moorland</a>, or open structured oak woodland – therefore heavy thining is required to produce a gappy character. They prefer low canopy medium sized trees, where low growing scrub and bramble less than 2 metre his is low and horizontal visibility is relatively high. They like a mosaic of grass and bracken, but not very grazed short turf, so light to moderate grazing is preferred, glades are also valuable. Streams are preferred.
Once they have arrived they nest on the ground amongst <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass" title="Grass">grass</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calluna" title="Calluna">heather</a> tussocks. They forage on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> found in the ground vegetation.
They need scattered trees as song perches.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
