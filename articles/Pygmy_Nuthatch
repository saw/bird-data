The <b>Pygmy Nuthatch</b> (<i>Sitta pygmaea</i>) is a tiny <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbird</a>, about 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;inches) long and about 10&nbsp;grams in weight. It ranges from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> south through various discontinuous parts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States" title="Western United States">western</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">U.S.</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_United_States" title="Northwestern United States">northwest U.S.</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" title="Sierra Nevada (U.S.)">Sierra Nevada</a> range, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Rockies" title="Southern Rockies" class="mw-redirect">southern Rockies</a>, etc.), to central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. It is usually found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine" title="Pine">pines</a> (especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponderosa_Pine" title="Ponderosa Pine" class="mw-redirect">Ponderosa Pines</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas-fir" title="Douglas-fir">Douglas-firs</a>, and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">conifers</a>. Pygmy Nuthatches clamber acrobatically in the foliage of these trees, feeding on insects and seeds; less often they creep along limbs or the trunk like bigger nuthatches.
Pygmy Nuthatches nest in cavities in dead stubs of conifers, lining the bottom of the cavity with pine-cone scales, plant down, and other soft plant and animal materials. They may fill cracks or crevices around the entrance with fur; the function of this behavior is unknown. The female lays 4–9 eggs, which are white with fine reddish-brown spotting. She does most of the incubation, which lasts about 16 days. The young leave the nest about 22 days after hatching.
This species is highly gregarious. A nesting pair may have other birds as helpers. Outside the breeding season, this bird wanders in noisy flocks. It also roosts communally; over 100 birds have been seen huddled in a single tree cavity.
All plumages are similar, with a warm gray cap, blue-gray upper-parts, and whitish underparts. The only feature not seen in the photograph is a whitish spot on the nape, particularly in worn plumage (summer). Vocalizations are highly varied chirps, peeps, and chattering.
This species is very similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-headed_Nuthatch" title="Brown-headed Nuthatch">Brown-headed Nuthatch</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States" title="Southeastern United States">southeastern U.S.</a> Their ranges have no overlap.
The Pygmy Nuthatch features prominently in the climax of the 2000 film <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie%27s_Angels_(film)" title="Charlie's Angels (film)">Charlie's Angels</a></i>, in which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Diaz" title="Cameron Diaz">Cameron Diaz</a>'s character, Natalie, discovers the location of the villains' fortress by identifying the call of the Pygmy Nuthatch, which she says only live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel,_California" title="Carmel, California" class="mw-redirect">Carmel, California</a>—though the bird shown is not a Pygmy Nuthatch, which in any case is found in a much wider range.
