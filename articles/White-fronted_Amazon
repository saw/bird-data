Juveniles have pale grey irises and less red on their face and the white area is replaced with a smaller yellowish area.<sup id="cite_ref-DA_2003_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DA_2003-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The species is divided into three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> with slight differences in colour and size:
The White-fronted Amazon is native to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>; and is most often seen in small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flock_(birds)" title="Flock (birds)">flocks</a> of up to 20 birds. They are seen in a variety of different habitats from wet regions such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest" title="Rainforest">rainforests</a>, to drier areas such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus" title="Cactus">cactus</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savannahs</a>. In the wild, they are not shy and people are often able to approach them. Flocks may congregate and people have seen groups that number into the hundreds. These groups may also contain flocks from other species such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-lored_Amazon" title="Red-lored Amazon">Red-lored Amazon</a>.
The White-fronted Amazon nests in tree cavities. Their breeding season is usually in the spring, starting in February and ending in the summer (in June and July in most areas). After breeding, the female will lay an average of three to four white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>. Eggs are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubated</a> for about 26 days and chicks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">leave the nest</a> at the age of about 60 weeks from hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-DA_2003_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DA_2003-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
