Taiga Bean-Goose <i>Anser fabalis</i><br />
Tundra Bean-Goose <i>Anser serrirostris</i>
The <b>Bean Goose</b> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose" title="Goose">goose</a> that breeds in northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. It has two distinct varieties, one inhabiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiga" title="Taiga">taiga</a> habitats and one inhabiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a>. These are recognised as separate species by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a>, but are considered a single species by other authorities, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="British Ornithologists' Union">British Ornithologists' Union</a>. It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> and winters further south in Europe and Asia.
The length ranges from 68 to 90 centimetres (27–35 in), wingspan from 140 to 174 centimetres (55–69 in) and weight from 1.7–4 kilograms (3.7–8.8 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominate_subspecies" title="Nominate subspecies" class="mw-redirect">nominate subspecies</a>, males average 3.2&nbsp;kg (7.1&nbsp;lb) and females average 2.84&nbsp;kg (6.3&nbsp;lb).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The bill is black at the base and tip, with an orange band across the middle; the legs and feet are also bright orange.
The upper wing-coverts are dark brown, as in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-fronted_Goose" title="White-fronted Goose" class="mw-redirect">White-fronted Goose</a> (<i>Anser albifrons</i>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_White-fronted_Goose" title="Lesser White-fronted Goose">Lesser White-fronted Goose</a> (<i>A. erythropus</i>), but differing from these in having narrow white fringes to the feathers.
The voice is a loud honking, higher pitched in the smaller subspecies.
The closely related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink-footed_Goose" title="Pink-footed Goose">Pink-footed Goose</a> (<i>A. brachyrhynchus</i>) has the bill short, bright pink in the middle, and the feet also pink, the upper wing-coverts being nearly of the same bluish-grey as in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylag_Goose" title="Greylag Goose">Greylag Goose</a>. In size and bill structure, it is very similar to <i>Anser fabalis rossicus</i>, and in the past was often treated as a sixth subspecies of Bean Goose.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature" title="Binomial nomenclature">scientific names</a> of the Bean Goose come from its habit in the past of grazing in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean" title="Bean">bean</a> field stubbles in winter (Latin <i>faba</i>, a bean).
There are five <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>, with complex variation in body size and bill size and pattern; generally, size increases from north to south and from west to east. Some ornithologists (including AOU 2007) split them into two species based on breeding habitat, whether in forest bogs in the subarctic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiga" title="Taiga">taiga</a>, or on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">arctic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a>.
The Bean Goose is a rare winter visitor to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Britain</a>. There are two regular wintering flocks of Taiga Bean Goose, in the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Yare_Valley&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Yare Valley (page does not exist)">Yare Valley</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> and the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Avon_Valley,_Scotland&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Avon Valley, Scotland (page does not exist)">Avon Valley</a>, Scotland. A formerly regular flock in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumfries_and_Galloway" title="Dumfries and Galloway">Dumfries and Galloway</a> no longer occurs there. The Tundra Bean Goose has no regular wintering sites, but is found in small groups among other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goose" title="Grey goose" class="mw-redirect">grey goose</a> species – among the most regular localities are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWT_Slimbridge" title="WWT Slimbridge">WWT Slimbridge</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucestershire" title="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holkham_Marshes" title="Holkham Marshes" class="mw-redirect">Holkham Marshes</a>, Norfolk.
