The <b>Black Turnstone</b> (<i>Arenaria melanocephala</i>) is a species of small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">wading</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a>. It is one of two species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnstone" title="Turnstone">turnstone</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i>Arenaria</i>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruddy_Turnstone" title="Ruddy Turnstone">Ruddy Turnstone</a> (<i>A. interpres</i>) being the other. It is now classified in the sandpiper family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scolopacidae" title="Scolopacidae" class="mw-redirect">Scolopacidae</a> but was formerly sometimes placed in the plover family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charadriidae" title="Charadriidae">Charadriidae</a>. It is native to the west coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and breeds only in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>.
It is 22-25 centimeters long and weighs 100-170 grams. The black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 20-27 millimeters long and slightly upturned. The legs and feet are blackish-brown with a reddish tinge. The bird is largely black and white in appearance. Breeding-plumaged adults have a black head and breast apart from a white spot between the eye and bill, a white stripe over the eye and white flecks on the sides of the breast. The upperparts are blackish-brown with pale fringes to the wing-coverts and scapular feathers. The belly and vent are white. In flight it shows a white wingbar, white shoulder patch and white tail with a broad black band across it. There is white from the lower back to the uppertail-coverts apart from a dark bar across the rump.
In winter the head and breast become largely dark brown with little white. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_(organism)" title="Juvenile (organism)">Juveniles</a> are similar to winter adults but browner with buff fringes to the wing-coverts and scapulars and a grey-brown tip to the tail.
The Ruddy Turnstone is similar but has rufous-brown markings on the upperparts and more white on the head and breast, particularly in breeding plumage. It has narrower wings and a narrower white wingbar. Its legs are orange and brighter than those of the Black Turnstone though there can be some overlap.
The Black Turnstone has a variety of calls, especially a rattling trill which can be heard throughout the year. This call is higher and less harsh than the similar call of the Ruddy Turnstone. Other calls include a loud, screeching alarm call and a soft, purring call uttered to young chicks. Displaying males produce a long series of staccato notes in flight as well as chirruping trills on the ground.
It breeds in western Alaska from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Peninsula" title="Alaska Peninsula">Alaska Peninsula</a> in the south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Hope,_Alaska" title="Point Hope, Alaska">Point Hope</a> in the north. The bulk of the population nests in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon-Kuskokwim_Delta" title="Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta" class="mw-redirect">Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta</a>. It usually nests near the coast but in some areas it occurs further inland along the shores of rivers and lakes. There are a handful of records from north-east <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a> but there has been no sign of breeding there. The world population is estimated at 95,000 birds with about 80,000 of these in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.
It winters on rocky shores along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Pacific</a> coast of North America from southern Alaska southwards as far as north-west <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> where it occurs in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California" title="Baja California">Baja California</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora" title="Sonora">Sonora</a> with a single record from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayarit" title="Nayarit">Nayarit</a>. It is very occasionally seen inland during spring and fall migration; there are a number of records from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salton_Sea" title="Salton Sea">Salton Sea</a> in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> and scattered sightings from inland US states including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana" title="Montana">Montana</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrancy_in_birds" title="Vagrancy in birds" class="mw-redirect">Vagrant</a> birds have been recorded from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon" title="Yukon">Yukon</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territories" title="Northwest Territories">Northwest Territories</a> and there is one record from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Crist%C3%B3bal_Island" title="San Cristóbal Island">San Cristóbal Island</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands" title="Galápagos Islands">Galápagos Islands</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
It feeds mainly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrates" title="Invertebrates" class="mw-redirect">invertebrates</a>, particularly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusk" title="Mollusk" class="mw-redirect">mollusks</a> in winter and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> during the breeding season. Seeds, eggs and carrion are also taken. At the breeding grounds it mainly feeds in wet meadows with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyperaceae" title="Cyperaceae">sedges</a>. In winter, its typical habitat is rocky coasts but it also feeds on beaches, mudflats and man-made structures such as jetties and breakwaters. It uses its bill to turn over stones, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alga" title="Alga" class="mw-redirect">algal</a> mats and other objects to get at prey hidden beneath.
It arrives on its breeding ground from early May to early June with the males arriving first. The birds often return to the same territory and pair with the same mate as previous years. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> is a scrape dug mainly by the male. It is usually located amongst sedges or grasses or under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow" title="Willow">willows</a>. Four <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> are usually laid; they are olive or pale greenish with darker spots. The eggs are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubated</a> for 21–24 days by both parents. The young birds are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial" title="Precocial">precocial</a> and are able to leave the nest and feed themselves soon after hatching. They are able to fly well after 25–34 days.
