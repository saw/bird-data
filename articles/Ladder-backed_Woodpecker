The <b>Ladder-backed Woodpecker</b> (<i>Picoides scalaris</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a>.
The Ladder-backed Woodpecker is fairly common in dry brushy areas and thickets and has a rather large range. The species can be found year-round over the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">southwestern United States</a> (north to extreme southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> and extreme southeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>), most of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, and locally in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>.
The Ladder-backed Woodpecker is a small woodpecker about 16.5 to 19&nbsp;cm (6½ to 7½ inches) in length. It is primarily colored black and white, with a barred pattern on its back and wings resembling the rungs of a ladder. Its rump is speckled with black, as are its cream-colored underparts on the breast and flanks. Southern populations have duskier buff breasts and distinctly smaller bills. Adult males have a red crown patch that is smaller in immatures and lacking in adult females. The Ladder-backed Woodpecker is very similar in appearance to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuttall%27s_Woodpecker" title="Nuttall's Woodpecker">Nuttall's Woodpecker</a>, but has much less black on its head and upper back, and the range of the two species only intersects a minimal amount in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California" title="Baja California">Baja California</a>. Hybrids are known.
Ladder-backed Woodpeckers nest in cavities excavated from tree trunks, or in more arid environments a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus" title="Cactus">cactus</a> will do. The female lays between 2 and 7 eggs, which are plain white. The eggs are incubated by both sexes, but the nesting period and other details are unknown.
Like most other woodpeckers the Ladder-backed Woodpecker bores into tree-trunks with its chisel-like bill to hunt for insects and their larva, but it also feeds on fruit produced by cacti.
