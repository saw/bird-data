The <b>Rufous Hummingbird</b> (<i>Selasphorus rufus</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird" title="Hummingbird">hummingbird</a>, about 8&nbsp;cm long (3 inches) with a long, straight and very slender bill. The female is slightly larger than the male.
The adult male, (shown in the photo), has a white breast, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufous" title="Rufous">rufous</a> face, upperparts, flanks and tail and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence" title="Iridescence">iridescent</a> orange-red throat patch (gorget). Some males have some green on back and/or crown. The female has green upperparts with some white, some iridescent orange <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">feathers</a> in the center of the throat, and a dark tail with white tips and rufous base. Females and the rare green-backed males are extremely difficult to differentiate from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_Hummingbird" title="Allen's Hummingbird">Allen's Hummingbird</a>. This is a typical-sized hummingbird, being a very small bird. It weighs 2–5 g (0.071–0.18 oz), measures 7–9 cm (2.8–3.5 in) long and spans 11&nbsp;cm (4.3&nbsp;in) across the wings.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
They feed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectar" title="Nectar">nectar</a> from flowers using a long extendible tongue or catch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> on the wing. These birds require frequent feeding while active during the day and become torpid at night to conserve energy.
Because of their small size, they are vulnerable to insect-eating birds and animals.
Their breeding habitat is open areas and forest edges in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>. This bird nests further north than any other hummingbird. The female builds a nest in a protected location in a shrub or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">conifer</a>. The male aggressively defends feeding locations within his territory. The same male may mate with several females.
They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, many of them migrating through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and nearby lowlands in July and August to take advantage of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildflower" title="Wildflower">wildflower</a> season there. They may stay in one spot for considerable time, in which case the migrants, like breeding birds, often aggressively take over and defend feeding locations. Most winter in wooded areas in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrero" title="Guerrero">Guerrero</a>, traveling over 2,000 miles by an overland route from its nearest summer home—a prodigious journey for a bird weighing only three or four grams.
This is the western hummingbird most likely to stray into eastern North America. In the United States, there has been an increasing trend for them to migrate southeast to winter in warmer climates like Florida or on the Gulf Coast, rather than in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. (They do arrive at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turks_and_Caicos_Islands" title="Turks and Caicos Islands">Turks and Caicos Islands</a>.) This trend is the result of increased survival with the provision of artificial feeders in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden" title="Garden">gardens</a>. In the past, individuals that migrated eastward toward Canada and the northern USA in error would usually die, but now they often survive as they seem to spend more time in the warm Gulf Coast and Florida. Provided sufficient food and shelter is available, they are surprisingly hardy, able to tolerate temperatures down to at least -20°C, so they can be seen in late fall in places like the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, and upper New England. As winter comes birds in these areas normally head to the warmer Gulf coast and Florida.
Most hummingbirds that migrate east are juvenile birds and may occasionally be adult females but are very seldomly adult males. Since juvenile or female are essentially indistinguishable from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_Hummingbird" title="Allen's Hummingbird">Allen's Hummingbirds</a> unless they are examined in hand, many of the eastern vagrants are classified as "Rufous/Allen's Hummingbird". However, a majority are believed to be from the Rufous species.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
In 2005, a research team led by Dr. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Warrick" title="Douglas Warrick">Douglas Warrick</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University" title="Oregon State University">Oregon State University</a> used trained rufous hummingbirds in a study to determine the mechanics of hummingbird hovering. The study employed digital particle imaging velocimitry to capture the bird’s wing movements on film, which enabled the discovery that the hummingbird’s hovering is achieved due primarily to its wing’s downstroke (which accounts for 75% of its lift) rather than its upstroke (which makes up the additional 25% of the lift).<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
