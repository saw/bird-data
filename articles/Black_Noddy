The <b>Black Noddy</b> or <b>White-capped Noddy</b> (<i>Anous minutus</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">tern</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family(biology)" title="Family(biology)" class="mw-redirect">family</a>. It resembles the closely related Brown or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Noddy" title="Common Noddy" class="mw-redirect">Common Noddy</a> (<i>A. stolidus</i>), but is smaller with darker plumage, a whiter cap, a longer, straighter beak and shorter tail. It was long - and sometimes still is - included within the Brown Noddy.
The nests of these birds consist on a level platform, often created in the branches of trees by a series of dried leaves covered with bird droppings. One egg is laid each season, and nests are re-used in subsequent years.
The Black Noddy has a worldwide distribution in tropical and subtropical seas, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird_colony" title="Seabird colony" class="mw-redirect">colonies</a> widespread in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and more scattered across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic" title="Atlantic" class="mw-redirect">Atlantic</a> and in the northeast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. At sea it is usually seen close to its breeding colonies within 80&nbsp;km of shore. Birds return to colonies, or other islands, in order to roost at night.
There are seven listed sub-species, including <i>Anous minutus melanogenys</i> and <i>Anous minutus marcusi</i>.
