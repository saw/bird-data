The <b>Least Bittern</b> (<i>Ixobrychus exilis</i>) is a small wading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a>, the smallest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron" title="Heron">heron</a> found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a>.
This is one of the smallest herons in the world, with perhaps only the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Bittern" title="Dwarf Bittern">Dwarf Bittern</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-backed_Bittern" title="Black-backed Bittern">Black-backed Bittern</a> averaging smaller in length.<sup id="cite_ref-Handbook1_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Handbook1-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> This tiny bittern can measure from 28 to 36 cm (11 to 14 in) in length, and the wingspan ranges from 41 to 46 cm (16 to 18 in). Body mass is from 51 to 102 g (1.8 to 3.6 oz), with most birds between 73 and 95 g (2.6 and 3.4 oz), making this perhaps the lightest of all herons.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> This bird's underparts and throat are white with light brown streaks. Its face and the sides of the neck are light brown; it has yellow eyes and a yellow bill. The adult male is glossy greenish black on the back and crown; the adult female is glossy brown on these parts. They show light brown parts on the wings in flight.
This Least Bittern is often an elusive bird. They spend much time straddling reeds. When alarmed, the Least Bittern freezes in place with its bill pointing up, turns its front and both eyes toward the source of alarm, and sometimes sways to resemble wind-blown marsh vegetation. This is perhaps a predator-avoidance behavior, since its small size makes the bittern vulnerable to many potential predators. Thanks to its habit of perching among the reeds, the Least Bittern can feed from the surface of water that would be too deep for the wading strategy of other herons. The Least Bittern and much larger and different-looking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bittern" title="American Bittern">American Bittern</a> often occupy the same wetlands, but may have relatively little interaction because of differences in foraging habits, preferred prey, and timing of breeding cycles. The Least Bittern arrives on its breeding grounds about a month after the American Bittern, and leaves one or two months earlier. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Audubon" title="John James Audubon">John James Audubon</a> noted that a young captive Least Bittern was able to walk with ease between two books standing 4&nbsp;cm (1.6&nbsp;in) apart. When dead, the bird's body measured 5.7&nbsp;cm (2.2&nbsp;in) across, indicating that it could compress its breadth to an extraordinary degree.
These birds nest in large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a> with dense vegetation from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>. The nest is a well-concealed platform built from cattails and other marsh vegetation. The female lays 4 or 5 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>, in extreme cases from 2 to 7. The eggs are pale blue or green. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating food. A second brood is often produced in a season.
These birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> from the northern parts of their range in winter for the southernmost coasts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and areas further south, travelling at night.
They mainly eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, which they capture with quick jabs of their bill while climbing through marsh plants.
The numbers of these birds have declined in some areas due to loss of habitat. They are still fairly common, but more often heard than seen. They prefer to escape on foot and hide than to take flight. These birds make cooing and clucking sounds, usually in early morning or near dusk.
