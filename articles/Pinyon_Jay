The <b>Pinyon Jay</b> (<i>Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay" title="Jay">jay</a> between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Jay" title="Blue Jay">Blue Jay</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Jay" title="Eurasian Jay">Eurasian Jay</a> in size. It is the only member of the genus <i><b>Gymnorhinus</b></i>, (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic_taxon" title="Monotypic taxon">monotypic</a>). Its overall proportions are very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark%27s_Nutcracker" title="Clark's Nutcracker">Nutcracker</a>-like and indeed this can be seen as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution" title="Convergent evolution">convergent evolution</a> as both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a> fill similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche" title="Ecological niche">ecological niches</a>. The pinyon jay is a bluish-grey coloured bird with deeper head colouring and whitish throat with black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a>, legs and feet.

This species is highly social, often forming very large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flock_(birds)" title="Flock (birds)">flocks</a> of 250 or more birds, and several birds always seem to act as <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sentry" class="extiw" title="wikt:sentry">sentries</a> for the flock, watching out for predators while their companions are feeding. The seed of the Pinyon pine is the staple food but they supplement their diet with fruits and berries. Insects of many types are also eaten and sometimes caught with its feet.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> is always part of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_colony" title="Bird colony">colony</a> but there is never more than one nest in a tree. Sometimes the colony can cover quite extensive areas with a single nest in each tree (usually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniper" title="Juniper">juniper</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_oak" title="Live oak">live oak</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine" title="Pine">pine</a>). There are usually 3–4 eggs laid, quite early in the season. Incubation is usually 16 days. The male bird normally brings food near to the nest, and the female flies to him to receive it and take back to the nest to feed the chicks that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> around 3 weeks later. Young are normally fed only by their parents, but once they reach near-fledging size they can sometimes receive a meal from any passing member of the colony, which can continue for some time after leaving the nest.
The Pinyon Jay was first collected, recorded and described as a species from a specimen shot along the Maria River in Northern Montana during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Maximilian_of_Wied-Neuwied" title="Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied">Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied</a>, Expedition to the Interior of North America in 1833.

Pinyon jays form large flocks that are maintained in a variety of forms throughout the year. The breeding season during January and February is the only time of the year when the composition of the flock changes dramatically. Two flocks are formed, 1 with breeding birds and 1 with yearling non-breeding birds. A 3rd flock may form at this time, composed of breeding pairs that were unsuccessful in their 1st breeding attempt in order to try a 2nd breeding attempt. Despite separation into separate flocks at times, a high degree of sociality continues to be maintained.<sup id="cite_ref-r10_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r10-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r11_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r11-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>

A flock of 250 pinyon jays was studied in a ponderosa pine forest and adjacent pinyon-juniper woodland for 2.5 years near Flagstaff, Arizona. During January or February, the make-up of the pinyon jay flock changed dramatically as courtship activities increased.

Following at least 2 encounters with predators, pinyon jays learned to avoid building their nests in exposed areas of trees. Pinyon jays 7 or more years old learned to nest at low heights, enhancing concealment, and built their nests further out from the trunk early in the season in order to increase solar warming <sup id="cite_ref-r88_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r88-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> and reduce the energy costs of incubation.<sup id="cite_ref-r89_10-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r89-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>

In a ponderosa pine forest near Flagstaff, Arizona, pairs of birds not successful in their 1st nesting attempt formed satellite nesting colonies composed of 3 to 12 nests in late April.

Marzluff and Balda <sup id="cite_ref-r87_9-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r87-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> studied 708 pinyon jays in Flagstaff, Arizona, from 1972–1984. The heaviest mortality of pinyon jays occurred in the fall, perhaps due to increased foraging activity in relatively unfamiliar areas, associated with the pinyon seed harvest. An average of 74% of adults, 62% of yearlings and 41% of juveniles survived each year. Female pinyon jays experienced lower survivorship than males, perhaps because they perform the incubation and brooding.
In another study by Marzluff and Balda <sup id="cite_ref-r89_10-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r89-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> in Flagstaff, Arizona, survivorship of all age classes of pinyon jays was more strongly correlated with weather than with pinyon seed crop variations. Juveniles and yearlings had a better chance of survival when spring weather was warm and wet and pinyon crops were large compared to snowy springs and poor pinyon seed crops. Adults survived better during warm, wet, spring weather also but experienced highest survival during intermediate versus large pinyon seed crops. This may have been due to increased activity during harvest in large seed crop years and increased exposure to predators.
Following a study of 2 pinyon jay flocks near Flagstaff, Arizona, Clark and Gabaldon suggested that nest desertions by adults may be a response to low-temperature thermal stress of nestlings. Broods too young to thermoregulate may die from low-temperature thermal stress when left unattended. This thermal stress may be responsible for nest desertions before the chicks die. Nest desertion may also occur following partial depredation of the nest because of the high probability that a predator may return.<sup id="cite_ref-r30_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r30-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>
