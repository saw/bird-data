The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-naped_sapsucker" title="Red-naped sapsucker" class="mw-redirect">red-naped sapsucker</a> is distinguished by having a red nape (back of the head). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_woodpecker" title="Hairy woodpecker" class="mw-redirect">hairy woodpecker</a> has no red on the crown (front of the head) or throat and has blacker back. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downy_woodpecker" title="Downy woodpecker" class="mw-redirect">downy woodpecker</a> has same markings as the hairy woodpecker but is significantly smaller.
The breeding habitat of the yellow-bellied sapsucker is forested areas across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States" title="Northeastern United States">northeastern</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. They prefer young, mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> forests. There is also a disjunct population found in high elevations of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains" title="Appalachian Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>.
Like other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapsucker" title="Sapsucker">sapsuckers</a>, these birds drill holes in trees and eat the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sap" title="Sap" class="mw-redirect">sap</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> drawn to it. They may also pick insects from tree trunks or catch them in flight. They also eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a> and berries.
Yellow-bellied sapsuckers nest in a large cavity excavated in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> tree, often choosing one weakened by disease; the same site may be used for several years. Both the male and the female work in making the nest, where five or seven white eggs are well concealed. Both birds share in hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
They will mate with the same partner from year to year, as long as both birds survive. They sometimes hybridize with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-naped_sapsucker" title="Red-naped sapsucker" class="mw-redirect">red-naped sapsuckers</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-breasted_sapsucker" title="Red-breasted sapsucker" class="mw-redirect">red-breasted sapsuckers</a> where their breeding ranges overlap.
