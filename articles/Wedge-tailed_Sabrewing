There were once three recognized subspecies of Wedge-tailed Sabrewing (under the scientific name <i>C. curvipennis</i>), but all are now considered separate species, which have completely separate ranges.<sup id="cite_ref-Williamson_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Williamson-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-itis_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-itis-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve-winged_Sabrewing" title="Curve-winged Sabrewing">Curve-winged Sabrewing</a></b> (<i>C. curvipennis</i>) occurs closest to the U.S. border and has a slightly longer bill than <i>C. pampa</i>, which occurs from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras" title="Honduras">Honduras</a><sup id="cite_ref-Smithe_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Smithe-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula" title="Yucatán Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a>. <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-tailed_Sabrewing" title="Long-tailed Sabrewing">Long-tailed Sabrewing</a></b> (<i>C. excellens</i>) is the other taxon.<sup id="cite_ref-excellens_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-excellens-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Wedge-tailed Sabrewing is a large hummingbird with a long wedge-shaped tail. Upperparts are green with blue to violet-blue crown that blends into the green nape. It has a white spot behind its eyes and a dark gray cheek. Underparts are pale gray to whitish, often slightly darker laterally. The bill is long and ranges from straight to slightly decurved, and the lower mandible is pinkish at base.<sup id="cite_ref-Williamson_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Williamson-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The adult male is slightly larger than the female, but other than that sexes are similar.<sup id="cite_ref-Williamson_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Williamson-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Juveniles are similar to adults but duller in coloring.<sup id="cite_ref-Williamson_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Williamson-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
<i>C.c. pampa</i> are 5½ inches long.<sup id="cite_ref-Smithe_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Smithe-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Males weigh 6½ grams and females weigh 5 grams.<sup id="cite_ref-Smithe_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Smithe-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Its eyes are very dark brown, appearing black, and legs are dark brown.<sup id="cite_ref-Smithe_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Smithe-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Wedge-tailed Sabrewing resides in humid tropical forests, woodlands, and dense second growth, ranging from near sea level to 4500 feet above sea level.<sup id="cite_ref-Williamson_1-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Williamson-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> It is not known to migrate.<sup id="cite_ref-Williamson_1-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Williamson-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Wedge-tailed Sabrewing often forages along walls of vegetation at forest edges and on steep slopes.<sup id="cite_ref-Williamson_1-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Williamson-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Its flight style varies from the rapid wingbeats of typical hummingbirds to slower wingbeats like those of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift" title="Swift">swifts</a>.

Calls include steady, persistent chipping and a shrill, nasal <i>peek</i>. The Wedge-tailed Sabrewing usually sings from dense vegetation, and its songs are complex and variable, usually including insect-like chips, squeaks, and squeals, followed by a series of excited warbled or gurgling notes.<sup id="cite_ref-Williamson_1-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Williamson-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Males sing year-round, sometimes in small groups. Some tail or wing movements are associated with perched singing displays.<sup id="cite_ref-Williamson_1-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Williamson-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
