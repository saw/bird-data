The <b>Green Heron</b> (<i>Butorides virescens</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron" title="Heron">heron</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>. It was long considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific" title="Conspecific" class="mw-redirect">conspecific</a> with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_species" title="Sister species" class="mw-redirect">sister species</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striated_Heron" title="Striated Heron">Striated Heron</a> (<i>Butorides striata</i>), and together they were called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green-backed_Heron" title="Green-backed Heron">Green-backed Heron</a>". Birds of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominate_subspecies" title="Nominate subspecies" class="mw-redirect">nominate subspecies</a> (no matter which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic" title="Taxonomic" class="mw-redirect">taxonomic</a> arrangement is preferred) are extremely rare vagrants to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>; individuals from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Pacific</a> coast of North America may similarly stray as far as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw-clo-adw_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-clo-adw-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Green Heron is relatively small; adult body length is about 44&nbsp;cm (17&nbsp;in). The neck is often pulled in tight against the body. Adults have a glossy, greenish-black cap, a greenish back and wings that are grey-black grading into green or blue, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut_(color)" title="Chestnut (color)">chestnut</a> neck with a white line down the front, grey underparts and short yellow legs. The bill is dark with a long, sharp point. Female adults tend to be smaller than males, and have duller and lighter plumage, particularly in the breeding season. Juveniles are duller, with the head sides, neck and underparts streaked brown and white, tan-splotched back and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_covert" title="Wing covert" class="mw-redirect">wing coverts</a>, and greenish-yellow legs and bill. Hatchlings are covered in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_feather" title="Down feather">down feathers</a>, light grey above, and white on the belly.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw-clo-adw_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-clo-adw-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Green Heron's call is a loud and sudden <i>kyow</i>; it also makes a series of more subdued <i>kuk</i> calls. During courtship, the male gives a <i>raah-rahh</i> call with wide-open bill, makes noisy wingbeats and <i>whoom-whoom-whoom</i> calls in flight, and sometimes calls <i>roo-roo</i> to the female before landing again. While sitting, an <i>aaroo-aaroo</i> courtship call is also given.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
As noted above, this species was formerly included in <i>B. striata</i>, which at that time was erroneously known as <i>B. striatus</i>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Pleistocene" title="Early Pleistocene">Early Pleistocene</a> <i>B. validipes</i>, whose fossil remains were discovered in Florida, might have been the ancestor of the Green Heron as the living species seems to replace the extinct relative in the fossil record.
Subspecies distinction is uncertain at best. The color variation between populations is less pronounced than between birds of the same population. Migratory populations are longer-winged than those resident year round, but this cannot be used to delimit subspecies as it is quite obviously is a consequence of differing habits and can be expected to undergo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution" title="Convergent evolution">convergent evolution</a> in unrelated populations of this species that just share the same habits. Thus, thorough <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogeny" title="Molecular phylogeny" class="mw-redirect">molecular phylogenetic</a> studies would be required to resolve the question of subspecies delimitation.
The following subspecies are commonly listed, though the validity of most of them is seriously disputed:<sup id="cite_ref-hbw_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Much of the dispute hinges upon the distinctness of the Caribbean and Central American populations, the second <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon" title="Taxon">taxon</a> in this species to be described. To describe the two most extreme views, some authors assemble the bulk of the mainland population in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominate_subspecies" title="Nominate subspecies" class="mw-redirect">nominate subspecies</a> but treat the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapatric" title="Parapatric" class="mw-redirect">parapatric</a> populations as distinct subspecies, while others place all resident populations in <i>maculata</i> and all migratory ones in <i>virescens</i>.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a> of the Green Heron is small wetlands in low-lying areas. The species is most conspicuous during dusk and dawn, and if anything these birds are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal" title="Nocturnal" class="mw-redirect">nocturnal</a> rather than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnality" title="Diurnality">diurnal</a>, preferring to retreate to sheltered areas in daytime. They feed actively during the day, however, if hungry or provisioning young. Shore-living individuals adapt to the rhythm of the tides. They mainly eat small fish, frogs and aquatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a>, but may take any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrate</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> prey they can catch, including such animals like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech" title="Leech">leeches</a> and mice. Green Herons are intolerant of other birds - including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific" title="Conspecific" class="mw-redirect">conspecifics</a> - when feeding and are not seen to forage in groups. They typically stand still on shore or in shallow water or perch upon branches and await prey. Sometimes they drop food, insects, or other small objects on the water's surface to attract fish, making them one of the few known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Tool-using_species" title="Category:Tool-using species">tool-using species</a>. This feeding method has led some to title the green and closely related Striated Heron as among the world's most intelligent birds.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> They are able to hover briefly to catch prey.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw-clo-adw_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-clo-adw-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The northern population moves to its breeding ranges during March and April; near the northernmost limit of the Green Heron's range, breeding is well underway by the end of May. The migration to the winter quarters starts in September; by late October, the birds are absent from regions where they do not stay all year. At least the northward migration does not seem to be affected by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>; birds appear in their breeding ranges at the same time they did 100 years ago.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
Individuals of non-migratory populations abandon their territories after breeding season to roam about the region. They may or may not return to the previous year's breeding location, depending on whether they found better habitat during these wanderings. In these populations, the breeding season is determined by rainfall and consequent prey availability.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw-clo-adw_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-clo-adw-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Green Herons are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonally" title="Seasonally" class="mw-redirect">seasonally</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a>. The pairs form in the breeding range, after an intense courtship display by the males, who select the nesting sites and fly in front of the female noisily and with puffed-up head and neck plumage. They nest in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forest</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp" title="Swamp">swamp</a> patches, over water or in plants near water. Nests are a platform of sticks, often in shrubs or trees, sometimes on the ground. Locations in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trees" title="Trees" class="mw-redirect">trees</a> are preferred, with some nests built up to 20 meters off the ground although heights of several meters are more common. Rarely, large numbers of these birds congregate in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heronry" title="Heronry">heronries</a> for nesting.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw-clo-adw_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-clo-adw-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)" title="Clutch (eggs)">clutch</a> is usually 2-6 pale green eggs,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> which are laid in 2-day intervals (though the second egg may be laid up to 6 days later than the first).<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> After the last egg has been laid, both parents <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubate_(bird)" title="Incubate (bird)" class="mw-redirect">incubate</a> for about 19–21 days until hatching, and feed the young birds.<sup id="cite_ref-SAS_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SAS-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> The frequency of feedings decreases as the offspring near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledging" title="Fledging" class="mw-redirect">fledging</a>. The young sometimes start to leave the nest at 16 days of age, but are not fully fledged and able to fend for themselves until 30–35 days old. Sometimes - particularly in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical" title="Tropical" class="mw-redirect">tropical</a> parts of its range - the Green Heron breeds twice a year.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw-clo-adw_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-clo-adw-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Green herons are one of the few species of animal known to use tools. In particular, they commonly use bread crusts, insects, or other items as bait. The bait is dropped onto the surface of a body of water in order to lure fish. When a fish takes the bait, the green heron will then grab and eat the fish. <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
