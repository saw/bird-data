The <b>Hawai<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i <span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Ō<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ō</b> (<i><b>Moho nobilis</b></i>) is a member of the extinct genus of the <span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Ō<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ōs (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moho_(genus)" title="Moho (genus)">Moho</a></i>) within the extinct family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohoidae" title="Mohoidae">Mohoidae</a>. It was previously regarded as member of the Australo-Pacific <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeyeater" title="Honeyeater">honeyeaters</a> (<i>Meliphagidae</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-Fleischer_2008_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fleischer_2008-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The 'Hawai<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i <span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Ō<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ō was first described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasius_Merrem" title="Blasius Merrem">Blasius Merrem</a> in 1786. It had an overall length of 32 centimetres (13&nbsp;in), wing length of 11–11.5 centimetres (4.3–4.5 in), and tail length of up to 19 centimetres (7.5&nbsp;in). The colour of its plumage was glossy black with a brown shading at the belly. It was further characterized by yellowish tufts at the axillaries. It had some yellowish plumes on its rump, but lacked yellow thigh feathers like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop%27s_%CA%BB%C5%8C%CA%BB%C5%8D" title="Bishop's ʻŌʻō">Bishop's <span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Ō<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ō</a>, and also lacked the whitish edgings on its tail feathers like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%CA%BBahu_%CA%BB%C5%8C%CA%BB%C5%8D" title="Oʻahu ʻŌʻō">O<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ahu <span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Ō<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ō</a>. However it had the largest yellow plumes on its wings out of all the species of <span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Ō<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ō.
At the time of discovery by Europeans, it was still relatively common on the Big Island, but that was soon to change. The Hawai<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i <span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Ō<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ō was extensively hunted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Hawaiians" title="Native Hawaiians">Native Hawaiians</a>. Its striking plumage was used for <i><span class="unicode">ʻ</span>a<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ahu ali<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i</i> (robes) and <i><span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ahu <span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ula</i> (capes) of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali%27i" title="Ali'i" class="mw-redirect">ali<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i</a></i> (Hawaiian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility" title="Nobility">nobility</a>). The Europeans too saw the striking beauty of this bird and hunted many of them for specimens in personal collections. Some were even caught and were put in cages to be sold as song birds only to live for a few weeks or days before diseases from mosquitoes had befallen them. The decline of this bird was hastened by both natives and Europeans by the introduction of the musket which allowed hunter and collectors to shoot birds down from far away places and from great heights and numbers. As late as 1898, hunters were still able to kill over a thousand of the birds, but after that year the <span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Ō<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ō population declined rapidly.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The birds became too rare to be shot in any great quantities, but continued to be found for nearly 30 years. The last known sighting was in 1934 on the slopes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Loa" title="Mauna Loa">Mauna Loa</a>.
