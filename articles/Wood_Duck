The Wood Duck is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perching_duck" title="Perching duck">perching duck</a>. A typical adult is from 47 to 54 cm (19 to 21 in) in length with a wingspan of between 66 to 73 cm (26 to 29 in). This is about three-quarters of the length of an adult <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallard" title="Mallard">Mallard</a>. It shares its genus with the Asian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Duck" title="Mandarin Duck">Mandarin Duck</a> (<i>Aix galericulata</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The adult male has distinctive multicoloured iridescent plumage and red eyes,with a distinctive white flare down the neck. The female, less colourful, has a white eye-ring and a whitish throat. Both adults have crested heads.
The male's call is a rising whistle, "jeeeeee"; the females utter a drawn-out, rising squeal, "oo-eek," when flushed, and a sharp "cr-r-ek, cr-e-ek" for an alarm call.<sup id="cite_ref-DU_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DU-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Their breeding habitat is wooded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp" title="Swamp">swamps</a>, shallow lakes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a> or ponds, and creeks in eastern North America, the west coast of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. They usually nest in cavities in trees close to water, although they will take advantage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest_box" title="Nest box">nesting boxes</a> in wetland locations if available. Females line their nests with feathers and other soft materials, and the elevation provides some protection from predators.<sup id="cite_ref-LPZWoodDuck_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LPZWoodDuck-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Unlike most other ducks, the Wood Duck has sharp claws for perching in trees and can, in southern regions, produce two broods in a single season—the only North American duck that can do so.<sup id="cite_ref-DU_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DU-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Females typically lay between 7 and 15 white-tan eggs that incubate for an average of 30 days.<sup id="cite_ref-DU_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DU-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> However, if nesting boxes are placed too close together, females may lay eggs in the nests of their neighbours, which may lead to nests which may contain as many as 30 eggs and unsuccessful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubate_(bird)" title="Incubate (bird)" class="mw-redirect">incubation</a>, a behaviour known as "nest dumping".<sup id="cite_ref-NPWRC_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NPWRC-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
After hatching, the ducklings jump down from the nest tree and make their way to water. The mother calls them to her, but does not help them in any way.<sup id="cite_ref-LPZWoodDuck_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LPZWoodDuck-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The ducklings may jump from heights of up to 88 metres (290&nbsp;ft) without injury. They prefer nesting over water so the young have a soft landing, but will nest up to 140&nbsp;m (150&nbsp;yd) away from the shoreline. The day after they hatch, the young climb to the nest entrance and jump to the ground. The ducklings can swim and find their own food by this time.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2011">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
These birds feed by dabbling or walking on land.

The population of the Wood Duck was in serious decline in the late 19th century as a result of severe habitat loss and market hunting both for meat and plumage for the ladies' hat market in Europe. By the beginning of the 20th century Wood Ducks had virtually disappeared from much of their former range. In response to the Migratory Bird Treaty established in 1916 and enactment of the Federal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act_of_1918" title="Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a>, wood duck populations began to recover slowly. By ending unregulated hunting and taking measures to protect remaining habitat, wood duck populations began to rebound in the 1920s. The development of the artificial nesting box in the 1930s gave an additional boost to Wood Duck production.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Landowners as well as park and refuge managers can encourage Wood Ducks by building Wood Duck nest boxes near lakes, ponds, and streams. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulda,_Minnesota" title="Fulda, Minnesota">Fulda</a>, Minnesota has adopted the Wood Duck as an unofficial mascot, and a large number of nest boxes can be found in the area.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2011">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
Expanding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Beaver" title="North American Beaver" class="mw-redirect">North American Beaver</a> populations throughout the Wood Duck's range have also helped the population rebound as beavers create an ideal forested wetland habitat for Wood Ducks.<sup id="cite_ref-Audubon_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Audubon-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
The population of the Wood Duck has increased a great deal in the last several years. The increase has been due to the work of many people constructing Wood Duck boxes and conserving vital habitat for the Wood Ducks to breed. During the open waterfowl season, U.S. hunters have only been allowed to take two Wood Ducks per day in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Flyway" title="Atlantic Flyway">Atlantic</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Flyway" title="Mississippi Flyway">Mississippi Flyways</a>. However, for the 2008–2009 season, the limit was raised to three. The Wood Duck limit remains at two in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Flyway" title="Central Flyway">Central Flyway</a> and at seven in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Flyway" title="Pacific Flyway">Pacific Flyway</a>. It is the second most commonly hunted duck in North America, after the mallard.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
