<i>Erolia subminuta</i>
The <b>Long-toed Stint</b>, <i>Calidris</i> or <i>Erolia subminuta</i>, is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">wader</a> bird. It breeds across northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a> and is strongly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering in south and south east Asia and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia" title="Australasia">Australasia</a>. It occurs in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> only as a very rare vagrant.
Little is known of the breeding habits of this species, although it nests on the ground, and the male has a display flight.
This bird has yellowish legs and a short thin dark bill. Breeding adults are a rich brown with darker feather centres above and white underneath. They have a light line above the eye and a brown crown. In winter, Long-toed Stints are grey above. The juveniles are brightly patterned above with rufous colouration and white mantle stripes.
This bird can be difficult to distinguish from other similar tiny waders which are known collectively as "peeps" or "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stint" title="Stint">stints</a>". In particular, Long-toed Stint is very similar to its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> counterpart, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Sandpiper" title="Least Sandpiper">Least Sandpiper</a>. It differs from that species in its more slender, longer-necked appearance, longer toes, somewhat brighter colours, and weaker wingbar.
These birds forage on mudflats, picking up food by sight, sometimes by probing. They mainly eat small crustaceans, insects and snails.
