The <b>Ochre-bellied Flycatcher</b> (<i>Mionectes oleagineus</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher" title="Tyrant flycatcher">tyrant flycatcher</a> family. It breeds from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> east of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a> as far as southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, and on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago" title="Trinidad and Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>.
This is a common bird in humid forests, usually in undergrowth near water. It makes a moss-covered ball nest with a side entrance, which is suspended from a root or branch, often over water. The female incubates the typical clutch of two or three white eggs for 18â€“20 days, with about the same period for the young, initially covered with grey down, to fledge.
Adult Ochre-bellied Flycatchers are 12.7&nbsp;cm long and weigh 11g. They have olive-green upperparts, and the head and upper breast are also green. The rest of the underparts are ochre-coloured, there are two buff wing bars, and the feathers of the closed wing are edged with buff. The male is slightly larger than the female, but otherwise similar.
There are a number of subspecies, which differ in the distinctness of the wing bars or the shade of the upperparts. This species was previously placed in the genus <i>Pipromorpha</i>.
Ochre-bellied Flycatcher is an inconspicuous bird which, unusually for a tyrant flycatcher, feeds mainly on seeds and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry" title="Berry">berries</a>, and some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a>.
The calls of the male include a high-pitched <i>chip</i>, and a loud <i>choo</i>. His display includes jumping, flutter-flight and hovering. He takes no part in rearing the young.
