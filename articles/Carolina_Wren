<i>T. (l.) albinucha</i> - White-browed Wren
The <b>Carolina Wren</b> (<i>Thryothorus ludovicianus</i>) is a common <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wren" title="Wren">wren</a>, resident in the eastern half of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">USA</a>, the extreme south of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and the extreme northeast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. A distinct population in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucatan" title="Yucatan" class="mw-redirect">Yucatan</a> Peninsula of Mexico, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize" title="Belize">Belize</a> and extreme north of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> is treated either as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> <i>Thryothorus ludovicianus albinucha</i>, or as a separate species, <b>White-browed Wren</b> (<i>Thryothorus albinucha</i>) . Following a 2006 review,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> these are the only wrens remaining in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><b>Thryothorus</b></i>. <i>T. ludovicianus</i> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_bird" title="State bird">state bird</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a>; its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_name_(zoology)" title="Specific name (zoology)">specific name</a> <i>ludovicianus</i> means "from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>".
Typically 12.5 to 14 cm (4.9 to 5.5 in) with a 29&nbsp;cm (11&nbsp;in) wingspan and a weight of about 18 to 23 g (0.63 to 0.81 oz), it is a fairly large wren; among the United States species it is second largest after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus_Wren" title="Cactus Wren">Cactus Wren</a>. Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 5.4 to 6.4 cm (2.1 to 2.5 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail" title="Tail">tail</a> is 4.5 to 5.6 cm (1.8 to 2.2 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmen_(bird)" title="Culmen (bird)" class="mw-redirect">culmen</a> is 1.4 to 1.8 cm (0.55 to 0.71 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 2 to 2.3 cm (0.79 to 0.91 in).<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The upperparts are rufous brown, and the underparts a strong orange-buff, usually unmarked but faintly barred on the flanks in the southwest of the range. The head has a striking pure white supercilium (eyebrow) and a whitish throat. The race <i>albinucha</i> is duller brown above and has additional white streaking on the head.
It is easiest to confuse with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bewick%27s_Wren" title="Bewick's Wren">Bewick's Wren</a>, a fairly close relative,<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> which differs in being smaller but with a longer tail, grayer-brown above and whiter below. The Carolina and White-browed Wrens differ from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Wren" title="House Wren">House Wren</a> in being larger, with a decidedly longer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> and hind toe; their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmen_(bird)" title="Culmen (bird)" class="mw-redirect">culmen</a> has a notch behind the tip.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Carolina Wren is noted for its loud song, popularly rendered as <i>"teakettle-teakettle-teakettle"</i>. This song is rather atypical among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrens" title="Wrens" class="mw-redirect">wrens</a>. A given bird will typically sing several different songs. Only the male birds sing their loud <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_song" title="Bird song" class="mw-redirect">song</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The songs vary regionally, with birds in northern areas singing more slowly than those in southern areas.
The Carolina Wren also has a series of calls, including a rapid series of descending notes in a similar timbre to its song, functioning as an alarm call, and a very harsh and loud scolding call made to threaten intruders.
The Carolina Wren is sensitive to cold weather. Since they do not migrate and stay in one territory the northern populations of Carolina wrens decrease markedly after severe winters. Because of this sensitivity to weather, gradually increasing temperatures over the last century may have been responsible for the northward range expansion seen in the mid-1900s.<sup id="cite_ref-COL:C.Wren_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COL:C.Wren-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
Populations in Canada and the northern half of the US experience regular crashes following severe winters, but their high breeding productivity soon results in a return to higher numbers. These birds are generally permanent residents throughout their range and defend territory year round; some birds may wander north after the breeding season.
They eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, found in leaf litter or on tree trunks; they may also eat small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard" title="Lizard">lizards</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_frog" title="Tree frog">tree frogs</a>. In winter, they occasionally eat seeds, berries, and other small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a>.
These birds prefer sites with dense undergrowth, either in mixed forests or in wooded suburban settings, in a natural or artificial cavity. The nest is a bulky, often domed structure, with a small hole towards the top. Nests of the more domestically-inclined wrens have been reported in a great variety of nooks and crannies in, about, or under buildings of various kinds, under bridges, or in holes in any structure such as a porch, fence-post, flowerpot, tree, house or barn. Almost any kind of receptacle may offer an acceptable nesting site. Pairs may mate for life.
Females typically lay between four to six eggs (normally over a period of several days) up to three times per year (but normally only twice). Eggs are oval, grayish-white and sprinkled with reddish-brown spots. Incubation is performed by the female only and lasts anywhere from 12–14 days, with the first young leaving the nest 12–14 days after hatching. Chicks hatch bald and blind, and depend upon parents until fledging. Both the male and female feed the young. They only brood for a short period of time after hatching, leaving the young in a warm, down-lined nest while adults search for food. If conditions are right, the same nest may be used more than once.
