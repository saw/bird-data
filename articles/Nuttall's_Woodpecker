Nuttall’s woodpecker has black wings and tail feathers with white barring. On the ventral surface, colour is white with black spots and barring. It has a black forehead with white streaks on the sides and an unbarred black region at the top of the back. Adult males have a distinguishable red crown which females do not. However, this physical feature is present in the juvenile of both sexes. They have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygodactyl" title="Zygodactyl" class="mw-redirect">zygodactyl</a> feet and stiff tail feathers which allows them to maintain a vertical position on trees; typical of woodpeckers. The mass of the Nuttall’s woodpecker ranges from 30 to 45 g (1.1 to 1.6 oz), with a body length of 16 to 18 cm (6.3 to 7.1 in).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>

Nuttall’s are a non-migratory species with a geographic range confined to northern California extending south towards the northwest region of Baja California, Mexico. Their preferred habitat is arid to mesic woodlands. In particular, these woodpeckers prefer oak woodlands, although they also occur in riparian sites and chaparral in the most southern parts of its range because of the decrease in oak abundance.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Individuals are found from sea level to 1250&nbsp;m, rarely to 2000&nbsp;m.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears from June 2012">page&nbsp;needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Vocalizations performed by Nuttall’s woodpecker are considered to be not of any harmonic. Some vocalizations have been described:
Call note – used between mated pairs to communicate their location to each other.
Double call – same function as call note can but also be used as a low threat alarm call.
Rattle call – used to establish territories when feeding
Kweek call – used between sexes mainly by female prior to copulation.
Both sexes drum. Rolls are relatively long, averaging over one second.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup><sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears from June 2012">page&nbsp;needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
The diet of Nuttall’s woodpeckers consists primarily of insects found on oaks. Common prey items include larvae of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Wood_borers&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Wood borers (page does not exist)">wood borers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_beetles" title="Click beetles" class="mw-redirect">click beetles</a>, and ants, but are the birds are also known to consume a variety of berry seeds. They also feed on sap from sap holes created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-breasted_Sapsucker" title="Red-breasted Sapsucker">red-breasted sapsuckers</a> in birch and willow. Foraging techniques used most often by Nuttall’s woodpecker are tapping and probing into crevices of trees to locate prey.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
Pair bonding occurs in late January to March with egg-laying mostly in April and May. Nuttall’s woodpeckers are socially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy" title="Monogamy">monogamous</a> and show displays of bi-parental care. New nests are excavated each year by males inside cavities of dead trees such as willow, oak, and alder. Clutch sizes range from 3 to 6 eggs with the male partner incubating the eggs at night and the female during the day. Incubation period can be up to 14 days. Fledglings are able to leave the nest after 15 days post hatch with parental care continuing for 14 days after that.
