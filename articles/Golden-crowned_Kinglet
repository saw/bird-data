The <b>Golden-crowned Kinglet</b> (<i>Regulus satrapa</i>) is a very small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbird</a>.
Adults are olive-gray on the upperparts with white underparts, with thin bills and short tails. They have white wing bars, a black stripe through the eyes and a yellow crown surrounded by black. The adult male has an orange patch in the middle of the yellow crown.
Their breeding habitat is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">coniferous</a> forests across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, the northeastern and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>. They nest in a well-concealed hanging cup suspended from a conifer branch.
These birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to the United States. Some birds are permanent residents in coastal regions and in the southern parts of their range. Northern birds remain further north in winter than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby-crowned_Kinglet" title="Ruby-crowned Kinglet">Ruby-crowned Kinglet</a>.
They forage actively in trees or shrubs, mainly eating insects, insect eggs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a>.
They give a series of high-pitched calls on a single note, and tend not to fear human approach.
Adults are olive-gray on the upperparts with white underparts, with thin bills and short tails. They have white wing bars, a black stripe through the eyes and a yellow crown surrounded by black. The adult male has an orange patch in the middle of the yellow crown. The juvenile is to adult, but with a browner back and without the yellow crown.<sup id="cite_ref-Sibley_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sibley-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Golden-crowned Kinglet is a widespread North American bird, breeding in many US states, and over much of Canada, and wintering across much of the continent south to Florida, Texas and Mexico. It also occurs in isolated mountain ranges in southern Mexico and Guatemala, where it is represented by separate subspecies.
The kinglets are a small group of birds sometimes included in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_warbler" title="Old World warbler">Old World warblers</a>, but frequently given family status,<sup id="cite_ref-BB852_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BB852-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> especially as recent research showed that, despite superficial similarities, the crests are taxonomically remote from the warblers.<sup id="cite_ref-Barker_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Barker-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Spicer_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Spicer-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The names of the family, Regulidae, and its only genus, <i>Regulus</i>, are derived from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>regulus</i>, a diminutive of <i>rex</i>, "a king",<sup id="cite_ref-Chambers_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Chambers-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> and refer to the characteristic orange or yellow crests of adult kinglets.
There are three migratory <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies_(biology)" title="Subspecies (biology)" class="mw-redirect">subspecies</a> in the United States and Canada, differing in size, bill length, back and rump colours, wing-bar width and colour, and length of supercilium:<sup id="cite_ref-Pyle_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pyle-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The subspecies "<i>amoenus</i>" has been synonymised with <i>apache</i> as the distinction between these populations are obscured by individual variation.<sup id="cite_ref-Pyle_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pyle-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
Two other (non-migratory) subspecies occur south of the bird's core range, although these are weakly differentiated from each other and so are perhaps best synonymised:<sup id="cite_ref-hbw_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
Hybridization with Ruby-crowned Kinglet has been reported to have possibly occurred.<sup id="cite_ref-Pyle_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pyle-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
