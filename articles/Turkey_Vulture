The Turkey Vulture, like most other vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. Because it lacks a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_(biology)" title="Syrinx (biology)" class="mw-redirect">syrinx</a>, it can only utter hisses and grunts.<sup id="cite_ref-Miskimen_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Miskimen-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> It usually hisses when it feels threatened.

The Turkey Vulture is gregarious and roosts in large community groups, breaking away to forage independently during the day. Several hundred vultures may roost communally in groups which sometimes even include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Black_Vulture" title="American Black Vulture" class="mw-redirect">Black Vultures</a>.

This vulture is often seen standing in a spread-winged stance. The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria.

The Turkey Vulture forages by smell, an ability that is uncommon in the avian world.

The Turkey Vulture arrives first at the carcass, or with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Yellow-headed_Vulture" title="Greater Yellow-headed Vulture">Greater Yellow-headed Vultures</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Yellow-headed_Vulture" title="Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture">Lesser Yellow-headed Vultures</a>, which also share the ability to smell carrion.<sup id="cite_ref-snyder_7-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-snyder-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> It displaces the Yellow-headed Vultures from carcasses due to its larger size,<sup id="cite_ref-cotton_45-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cotton-45"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> but is displaced in turn by the King Vulture and both types of condor, which make the first cut into the skin of the dead animal. This allows the smaller, weaker-billed, Turkey Vulture access to food, because it cannot tear the tough hides of larger animals on its own. This is an example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_dependence" title="Mutual dependence" class="mw-redirect">mutual dependence</a> between species.<sup id="cite_ref-Dietland_46-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dietland-46"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup>
The breeding season of the Turkey Vulture varies according to latitude.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> In the southern United States, it commences in March, peaks in April to May, and continues into June.<sup id="cite_ref-Georgia_48-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Georgia-48"><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup> In more northerly latitudes, the season starts later and extends into August.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49"><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup> Courtship rituals of the Turkey Vulture involve several individuals gathering in a circle, where they perform hopping movements around the perimeter of the circle with wings partially spread. In the air, one bird closely follows another while flapping and diving.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaufman_36-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kaufman-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eggs are generally laid in the nesting site in a protected location such as a cliff, a cave, a rock crevice, a burrow, inside a hollow tree, or in a thicket. There is little or no construction of a nest; eggs are laid on a bare surface. Females generally lay two eggs, but sometimes one and rarely three. The eggs are cream-colored, with brown or lavender spots around their larger end.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaufman_36-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kaufman-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> Both parents incubate, and the young hatch after 30 to 40 days. Chicks are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" title="Altricial">altricial</a>, or helpless at birth. Both adults feed the chicks by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)" title="Regurgitation (digestion)">regurgitating</a> food for them, and care for them for 10 to 11 weeks. When adults are threatened while nesting, they may flee, or they may regurgitate on the intruder or feign death.<sup id="cite_ref-Fergus_6-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fergus-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> If the chicks are threatened in the nest, they defend themselves by hissing and regurgitating.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaufman_36-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kaufman-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> The young fledge at about nine to ten weeks. Family groups remain together until fall.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaufman_36-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kaufman-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Turkey Vulture is sometimes accused of carrying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax" title="Anthrax">anthrax</a> or hog cholera, both livestock diseases, on its feet or bill by cattle ranchers and is therefore occasionally perceived as a threat.<sup id="cite_ref-mossman_50-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mossman-50"><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> However, the virus that causes hog cholera is destroyed when it passes through the Turkey Vulture's digestive tract.<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_28-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> This species also may be perceived as a threat by farmers due to the similar Black Vulture's tendency to attack and kill newborn cattle. The Turkey Vulture does not kill live animals but will mix with flocks of Black Vultures and will scavenge what they leave behind. Nonetheless, its appearance at a location where a calf has been killed gives the incorrect impression that the Turkey Vulture represents a danger to calves.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51"><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup> The droppings produced by Turkey Vultures and other vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation.<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52"><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup> The Turkey Vulture can be held in captivity, though the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act_of_1918" title="Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act</a> prevents this in the case of uninjured animals or animals capable of returning to the wild.<sup id="cite_ref-cornell_53-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cornell-53"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> In captivity, it can be fed fresh meat, and younger birds will gorge themselves if given the opportunity.<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_28-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Turkey Vulture species receives special legal protections under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act_of_1918" title="Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-FWS_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FWS-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-cornell2_54-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cornell2-54"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup> and by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-cornell2_54-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cornell2-54"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup> In the USA it is illegal to take, kill, or possess Turkey Vultures, and violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to $15,000 and imprisonment of up to six months.<sup id="cite_ref-cornell_53-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cornell-53"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> It is listed as a species of Least Concern by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List</a>.
