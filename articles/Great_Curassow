The <b>Great Curassow</b> (<i>Crax rubra</i>) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>: <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>hocofaisán, pavón norteño</i></span>) is a large, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheasant" title="Pheasant">pheasant</a>-like bird from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neotropic" title="Neotropic" class="mw-redirect">Neotropics</a>.
At 78–100 cm (31–39 in) in length and 3.1–4.8 kg (6.8–11 lb) in weight, this is a very large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracidae" title="Cracidae">cracid</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Females are somewhat smaller than males. It is the most massive and heavy species in the family but its length is matched by a few other cracids.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Four other species of curassow (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Helmeted_Curassow" title="Northern Helmeted Curassow" class="mw-redirect">Northern Helmeted</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Helmeted_Curassow" title="Southern Helmeted Curassow" class="mw-redirect">Southern Helmeted</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Curassow" title="Black Curassow">Black</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crested_Curassow" title="Crested Curassow" class="mw-redirect">Crested</a>) are all around the same average length as the Great Curassow. In this species, standard measurements are as follows: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 36 to 42.4 cm (14 to 16.7 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail" title="Tail">tail</a> is 29 to 38 cm (11 to 15 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 9.4 to 12 cm (3.7 to 4.7 in). They have the largest mean standard measurements in the family, but for tail length.<sup id="cite_ref-Hughes_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hughes-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
The male is black with a curly crest, a white belly, and a yellow knob on its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> There are three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morph_(zoology)" title="Morph (zoology)" class="mw-redirect">morphs</a> of female Great Curassows:<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Barred morph females with barred neck, mantle, wings and tail, rufous morph with an overall reddish brown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> and a barred tail, and dark morph female with a blackish neck, mantle and tail (the tail often faintly vermiculated), and some barring to the wings. In most regions only one or two morphs occur, and females showing a level of intermediacy between these morphs are known (e.g. resembling rufous morph, but with black neck and faint vermiculations to wings). This species has a similar voice to several other curassows, its call consisting of a "peculiar" lingering whistle.<sup id="cite_ref-Hughes_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hughes-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a> species, the Great Curassow is distributed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest" title="Rainforest">rainforest</a> from eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> throughout <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> and northwest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> In Mexico, it is abscent from drier western coastal forests but does occasionally occur in dry areas of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucatan" title="Yucatan" class="mw-redirect">Yucatan</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozumel_Island" title="Cozumel Island" class="mw-redirect">Cozumel Island</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>. The Great Currasow spends much of its time on the ground but nests and roosts in the trees. This species is gregarious, occurring in groupings of up to a dozen birds, though occasionally birds can be seen alone. Its diet consists mainly of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus" title="Ficus">figs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropods" title="Arthropods" class="mw-redirect">arthropods</a>. Small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a>, may supplement the diet on occasion, including small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammals" title="Mammals" class="mw-redirect">mammals</a> (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent" title="Rodent">rodents</a>) and small fledging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds" title="Birds" class="mw-redirect">birds</a>. Unlike other cracids, such as guans, they feed largely on fallen fruit rather than pluck fruit directly from the trees. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamaulipas" title="Tamaulipas">Tamaulipas</a>, it feeds largely on the fruit <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondias_mombin" title="Spondias mombin">Spondias mombin</a></i>. Elsewhere, it may prefer the red berries of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chione_(plant_genus)" title="Chione (plant genus)">Chione</a></i> trees.<sup id="cite_ref-Hughes_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hughes-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
The male Great Curassow may build the nest and attract a female's attention to it, though in other cases both members of a pair will built the nest structure. Two eggs are typically laid in a relatively small nest (usually made largely of leaves), each egg measuring 9.1&nbsp;cm ×&nbsp;6.7&nbsp;cm (3.6&nbsp;in ×&nbsp;2.6&nbsp;in) and weighing 200&nbsp;g (7.1&nbsp;oz). The young curassow weighs 123&nbsp;g (4.3&nbsp;oz) upon hatching, 2,760&nbsp;g (6.1&nbsp;lb) as a half-year-old immature and by a year of age, when fully fledged and independent of parental care, will be about three-quarters of their adult weight at 3,600&nbsp;g (7.9&nbsp;lb). This species has been noted for its rather aggressive temperament, which has been regularly directed at humans while the birds are held in captivity. Undoubtedly, they have this inclination in order to repel natural predators, from both themselves and their offspring. Known natural predators of this species have included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocelot" title="Ocelot">Ocelots</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornate_Hawk-Eagle" title="Ornate Hawk-Eagle">Ornate Hawk-Eagles</a>, though chicks and eggs likely have a broader range of predators. When a potential predator is near their offspring, curassows have been noted to engage in a distraction display, feigning injury. When attacking humans, the curassows lept in fluttering flight and scratch about the head, targeting the eyes. The lifespan in captivity has reached at least 24 years.<sup id="cite_ref-Hughes_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hughes-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Great Curassow is the most northernly <i>Crax</i> species. It is part of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade" title="Clade">clade</a> that inhabited the north of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> since about 9 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mya_(unit)" title="Mya (unit)" class="mw-redirect">mya</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortonian" title="Tortonian">Tortonian</a>, Late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene" title="Miocene">Miocene</a>). As the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombian</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a> were uplifted around 6 mya, this species' ancestors were cut off from the population to their southeast. The latter would in time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolve</a> into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-billed_Curassow" title="Blue-billed Curassow" class="mw-redirect">Blue-billed Curassow</a>. The ancestral Great Curassows then spread along the Pacific side of the Andes, and into Central America during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene" title="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene" title="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> (Pereira &amp; Baker 2004) as part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Interchange" title="Great American Interchange">Great American Interchange</a>.
Due to ongoing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_loss" title="Habitat loss" class="mw-redirect">habitat loss</a> and overhunting in some areas, the Great Curassow is evaluated as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species" title="Vulnerable species">Vulnerable</a> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List</a> of Threatened Species.
