The <b>Saltmarsh Sparrow</b> (<i>Ammodramus caudacutus</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_sparrow" title="American sparrow">sparrow</a>. At one time, this bird and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson%27s_Sparrow" title="Nelson's Sparrow">Nelson's Sparrow</a> were thought to be a single species, the <b>Sharp-tailed Sparrow</b>. Because of this, the species was briefly known as "Saltmarsh Sharp-tailed Sparrow".
The Saltmarsh Sparrow measures 11–14 cm (4.3–5.5 in) in length, spans 17.8–21 cm (7.0–8.3 in) across the wings and weighs from 14–23.1 g (0.49–0.81 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Adults have brownish upperparts with grey on the crown and nape, a cream-coloured breast with dark streaks and a white throat and belly; they have an orange face with grey cheeks and a short pointed tail. Distinguishing this species from closely related sparrows can be difficult, especially the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson%27s_Sparrow" title="Nelson's Sparrow">Nelson's Sparrow</a> which differs only in being more buffy on the chest with blurry dark streaks.
Their breeding habitat is salt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_(ocean)" title="Atlantic (ocean)" class="mw-redirect">Atlantic</a> coast of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine" title="Maine">Maine</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>. The nest is an open cup located above the high <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide" title="Tide">tide</a> line. Males compete for females but do not defend territories. Only females raise the young.
These birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> further south along the eastern coast of the United States. They forage on the ground or in marsh vegetation, sometimes probing in mud. They mainly eat insects, aquatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> and seeds. The call is a raspy trill.
This bird's numbers are declining due to habitat loss largely attributed to human activity.
