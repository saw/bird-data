The Ruddy-capped Nightingale-Thrush is a resident breeder in highlands from central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a>. It is found in the undergrowth of wet mountain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak" title="Oak">oak</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">conifer</a> forests and second growth, typically from about 1350&nbsp;m to 3500&nbsp;m altitude.
The Ruddy-capped Nightingale-thrush will normally forage on the forest floor, alone on in pairs, progressing in hops and dashes with frequent stops. It turns leaf litter in typical thrush fashion seeking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a>, and also eats small fruits.
The nest is a bulky lined cup constructed 1–4&nbsp;m high in dense undergrowth or a thicket, often near water. The two brown-blotched greyish or greenish-blue eggs are incubated by the female alone for 15–16 days to hatching, and the young are fed by both parents for 14–16 days more to fledgling.
