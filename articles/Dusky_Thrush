The <b>Dusky Thrush</b> (<i>Turdus eunomus</i>) is a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_(bird)" title="Thrush (bird)">thrush</a> family Turdidae which breeds eastwards from central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>. It is closely related to the more southerly breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naumann%27s_Thrush" title="Naumann's Thrush">Naumann's Thrush</a> <i>T. naumanni</i>; the two have often been regarded as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific" title="Conspecific" class="mw-redirect">conspecific</a>.
This species breeds in open woodland areas, but unlike Naumann's Thrush, Dusky Thrush is more tolerant of mountainous and tundra-edge habitats. This species is strongly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering south to southeast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, principally in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> and neighbouring countries. It is a rare vagrant to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>.
It nests in trees, laying 3-5 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> in an untidy but neatly lined nest. Migrating birds and wintering birds often form small flocks. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insects" title="Insects" class="mw-redirect">insects</a>, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito" title="Mosquito">mosquitoes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthworm" title="Earthworm">earthworms</a> and berries.
This is a medium-sized but stocky thrush, reminiscent in structure of a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldfare" title="Fieldfare">Fieldfare</a>. The underwing is reddish brown, and there is a pale <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Supercilium" class="extiw" title="wikt:Supercilium">supercilium</a>.
Dusky Thrush has a dark brown back and rump; the face, breast, and flank spots rump are black and the belly and undertail are white. Naumann's Thrush in comparison has a paler brown back and head; the face, breast, flank spots and rump are reddish, and the belly and undertail are white.
The female is fairly similar to the male, but immatures have a weaker patterning.
The male Dusky Thrush has a simple fluted or whistling song, similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwing" title="Redwing">Redwing</a>. There are suggestions that the songs of Dusky and Naumann's Thrush differ.
