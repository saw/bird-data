<i>Falco chrysaëtos</i> <small>Linnaeus, 1758</small>
The <b>Golden Eagle</b> (<i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>) is one of the best known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">birds of prey</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere" title="Northern Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>. Like all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle" title="Eagle">eagles</a>, it belongs to the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipitridae" title="Accipitridae">Accipitridae</a>. Once widespread across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holarctic" title="Holarctic">Holarctic</a>, it has disappeared from many of the more heavily populated areas. Despite being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extirpated" title="Extirpated" class="mw-redirect">extirpated</a> from or uncommon in some its former range, the species is still fairly ubiquitous, being present in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, and parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>. The highest density of nesting Golden Eagles in the world lies in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County" title="Alameda County" class="mw-redirect">Alameda County</a>, California. These birds are dark brown, with lighter golden-brown plumage on their heads and necks.
Golden Eagles use their agility and speed combined with extremely powerful talons to snatch up a variety of prey, including rabbits, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot" title="Marmot">marmots</a>, ground squirrels, and large mammals such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox" title="Fox">foxes</a> and young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungulate" title="Ungulate">ungulates</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Watson_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Watson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> They will also eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion" title="Carrion">carrion</a> if live prey is scarce, as well as reptiles. Birds, including large species up to the size of swans and cranes have also been recorded as prey. For centuries, this species has been one of the most highly regarded birds used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry" title="Falconry">falconry</a>, with the Eurasian subspecies having been used to hunt and kill unnatural, dangerous prey such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_Wolves" title="Gray Wolves" class="mw-redirect">Gray Wolves</a> (<i>Canis lupus</i>) in some native communities. Due to their hunting prowess, the Golden Eagle is regarded with great mystic reverence in some ancient, tribal cultures.
Golden Eagles maintain territories that may be as large as 155&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (60&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). They are monogamous and may remain together for several years or possibly for life. Golden Eagles nest in high places including cliffs, trees, or human structures such as telephone poles. They build huge <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nests</a> to which they may return for several breeding years. Females lay from one to four <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a>, and both parents incubate them for 40 to 45 days. Typically, one or two young survive to fledge in about three months.
The Golden Eagle is a large, dark brown raptor with broad wings. Its size is variable: it ranges from 66 to 102 cm (26 to 40 in) in length and it has a typical wingspan of 1.8 to 2.34 m (5.9 to 7.7 ft). In the largest race (<i>A. c. daphanea</i>) males and females weigh 4.05&nbsp;kg (8.9&nbsp;lb) and 6.35&nbsp;kg (14.0&nbsp;lb). In the smallest subspecies (<i>A. c. japonensis</i>), the sexes weigh, respectively, 2.5&nbsp;kg (5.5&nbsp;lb) and 3.25&nbsp;kg (7.2&nbsp;lb).<sup id="cite_ref-Watson_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Watson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> In the species overall, males average around 3.6&nbsp;kg (7.9&nbsp;lb) and females average around 5.1&nbsp;kg (11&nbsp;lb).<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The maximum size of this species is a matter of some debate, although the normal upper weight limit for a large female is around 6.8&nbsp;kg (15&nbsp;lb) and large races are the heaviest representatives of the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila_(genus)" title="Aquila (genus)">Aquila</a></i> genus.<sup id="cite_ref-Wood_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wood-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Captive birds have been measured up to a wingspan of 2.81&nbsp;m (9.2&nbsp;ft) and a mass of 12.1&nbsp;kg (27&nbsp;lb) (the latter figure was for an eagle bred for the purposes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry" title="Falconry">falconry</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-Wood_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wood-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The standard measurements of the species include a wing chord length of 52–72 cm (20–28 in), a tail length of 26.5–38 cm (10.4–15 in) and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> length of 9.4–12.2 cm (3.7–4.8 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmen_(bird)" title="Culmen (bird)" class="mw-redirect">culmen</a> reportedly averages around 4.5&nbsp;cm (1.8&nbsp;in), with a range of 3.6 to 5 cm (1.4 to 2.0 in) and the bill from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gape" title="Gape">gape</a> measures around 6&nbsp;cm (2.4&nbsp;in).<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The sexes are similar in plumage but are considerably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">dimorphic</a> in size, with females rather larger than males.<sup id="cite_ref-Terres478_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres478-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Adults are primarily brown, with a pale gold color on the back of the crown and nape, and some grey on the wings and tail.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">Tarsal</a> feathers range from white to dark brown.

Size readily distinguishes this species from most other raptors when it is seen well. Most other raptors are considerably smaller, including <i>Buteo</i> hawks which are perhaps most similar to the Golden Eagle in structure among smaller raptors. <i>Buteos</i> are also usually distinctly paler below.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell1_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell1-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> Only some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_vulture" title="Old World vulture">Old World vultures</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Condor" title="California Condor">California Condor</a> (<i>Gymnogyps californianus</i>) (among the other raptorial birds this eagle co-exists with) are distinctly larger, with longer, broader wings, typically held more evenly, and often have dramatically different color patterns. Compared to <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haliaeetus" title="Haliaeetus" class="mw-redirect">Haliaeetus</a></i> eagles, the Golden is usually longer-tailed and is distinctly smaller-headed, with broad wings that are more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawk</a>-like and less plank-like in shape. Whereas more <i>Haliaeetus</i> eagles are heavily streaked in their juvenile phase, the Golden has a more solidly golden-brown coloration. Distinguishing it from other <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila_(genus)" title="Aquila (genus)">Aquila</a></i> eagles in Eurasia is a greater identification problem. This identification may rely on the Golden's relatively long tail and patterns of white or gray on the wings and tail. At close range, the paler head and golden nape-shawl of the Golden are distinctive from other <i>Aquila</i>. Most other <i>Aquila</i> eagles are darker looking in plumage, although the slightly smaller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawny_Eagle" title="Tawny Eagle">Tawny Eagle</a> (<i>A. rapax</i>) is paler than the Golden Eagle.

Golden Eagles are fairly adaptable in habitat but often reside in areas with a few shared ecological characteristics. They are best suited to hunting in open or semi-open areas and search them out year-around. The largest numbers of Golden Eagles are found in mountainous regions today, with many eagles doing a majority of their hunting and nesting on rock formations. However, they are not solely tied to high elevations and can breed in lowlands if the local habitats are suitable. They can additionally be found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrubland" title="Shrubland">shrublands</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">coniferous forests</a> with openings and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe" title="Steppe">steppe</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie" title="Prairie">prairies</a> and other regional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland" title="Grassland">grassland</a> habitats. Though not generally a wetland bird, they may pass through or hunt in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a>, normally while migrating or wintering. Golden Eagles usually nest in desolate areas where human disturbances are minimal and often avoid highly populated areas year-around. They may be found in elevation from sea-level up to at least 3,700&nbsp;m (12,100&nbsp;ft).<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Some populations of Golden Eagles are migratory and others are sedentary. Eagles who nest in colder climes such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> tend to migrate to points further south due to declining available food sources in the north. Those found further south in the species' breeding range are usually non-migratory and may remain without striking distance of their breeding territories all year.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> While they usually fly at average speeds of 45–52 kilometers per hour (28–32 mph), they can glide quickly at up to 130 kilometers per hour (81&nbsp;mph) and can reach 240 kilometers per hour (150&nbsp;mph) when diving after prey. The characteristic flight of the species consists of a mix of flapping and soaring.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Golden Eagle is one of the most powerful predators in the avian world. They usually hunt by flying slowly while scanning the environment in a low quartering flight, often around mountainous slopes.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> When prey is spotted, the eagle makes a short dash hoping to surprise its prey or engages in a longer rapid chase. They also hunt by flying in a fast glide or soar followed by a sudden stoop. Rarely, they may also still-hunt, watching for prey from an elevated perch and then pouncing down when it is spotted.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Given that their favorite prey are often mammals or birds that hesitate to fly, unsurprisingly most of their prey is killed on the ground and some prey may even pursued on foot for a short distance by the eagle.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> When hunting birds, they may engage in an agile tail-chase (much in the style of the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter" title="Accipiter">Accipiter</a></i> hawks) and can occasionally snatch birds in mid-flight.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The powerful talons of the Golden Eagle ensure that few prey can escape them once contact is made. The talons of this species exert an estimated 440 pounds per square inch (3&nbsp;MPa) of pressure, though the largest individuals may reach a pressure of 750&nbsp;psi (5.2&nbsp;MPa), around 15 times more pressure than is exerted by the human hand.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup>
While they do show strong local preferences for certain prey, Golden Eagles are first and foremost opportunists and virtually any small to mid-sized animal may be predated if encountered. Nearly 200 species of mammal and bird have been recorded as golden eagle prey.<sup id="cite_ref-Watson_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Watson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Prey selection is largely determined by the local availability and abundance of the prey species.<sup id="cite_ref-Watson_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Watson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Most prey taken are around half the weight of the predating eagle, with a typical prey weight range of 0.5–4 kg (1.1–8.8 lb),<sup id="cite_ref-Watson_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Watson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> though this eagle will sometimes fly with prey equal to or slightly heavier than its own weight (4–7 kg (8.8–15 lb)).<sup id="cite_ref-Watson_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Watson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>

Numerous other types of prey may supplement the diet. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile" title="Reptile">Reptiles</a> are rarely taken over most of the range but prey such as large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake" title="Snake">snakes</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard" title="Lizard">lizards</a> appears to be fairly common in the southern reaches of its Asian range, as well as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> and in desert-like regions of central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Watson_2-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Watson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> In southeastern Europe, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmenistan" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> and other arid regions, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortoise" title="Tortoise">tortoises</a> are a favored prey item. Tortoises are dispatched using the same method employed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lammergeier" title="Lammergeier" class="mw-redirect">Lammergeier</a> (<i>Gypaetus barbatus</i>), which consists of flying with the bulky reptile and dropping it from some height onto rocks or other hard surfaces so the shell will crack open and its flesh can be eaten.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Other secondary prey items may include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian" title="Amphibian">amphibians</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> (which are eaten regularly in Southeast Asia but are usually scavenged) and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> such as large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle" title="Beetle">beetles</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> During winter months, when live-caught prey can be scarce, Golden Eagles often scavenge on carrion.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell1_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell1-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
Golden Eagles usually mate for life. They build several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyrie_(nest)" title="Eyrie (nest)" class="mw-redirect">eyries</a> within their territory and use them alternately for several years. In the western United States, eagles' nesting territories may range from 22 to 33 square miles, whereas those nesting further north may maintain territories of up to 39 square miles. Territories are maintained by flight displays.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> These nests consist of heavy tree branches, upholstered with grass when in use. Old eyries may be 2 metres (6.6&nbsp;ft) in diameter and 1 metre (3.3&nbsp;ft) in height, as the eagles repair their nests whenever necessary and enlarge them during each use. If the eyrie is situated on a tree, supporting tree branches may break because of the weight of the nest. Certain other animals—birds and mammals too small to be of interest to the huge raptor—often use the nest as shelter. Their predators are just the right size for Golden Eagle prey, and therefore avoid active eyries.
Mating and egg-laying time is variable depending on the locality and can be January and September, though is usually in March or later. The female lays one to four (usually two) eggs.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The eggs vary from all white to white with cinnamon or brown spots and blotches. Laying of the eggs occurs at 3 or 4 day intervals. The female starts incubation when the first egg is laid and continues to do so for 40 to 45 days, though the male may occasionally incubate as well.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> They are covered in fluffy white down and are fed and brooded consistently for 45–50 days, with both parents taking shifts at feeding the young.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The nestlings start to leave the nest after 45 days (sometimes as late 81 days) by walking, hopping or falling out of the nest. At around 10 weeks of age, they start to fly and, once fledged, begin to eat on their own. Independence from the parents may variably be attained 32 to 80 days after the young are fledged.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Juveniles usually become established and start to breed at 4 to 7 years of age.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson-Lees_4-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-Lees-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
In most cases only the older chick survives, while the younger one dies without leaving the eyrie. This is due to the older chick having a few days' advantage in growth and consequently winning most squabbles for food. This strategy is useful for the species because it makes the parents' workload manageable even when food is scarce, while providing a reserve chick in case the first-born dies soon after hatching. Golden Eagles invest much time and effort in bringing up their young; once able to hunt on their own, most Golden Eagles survive many years, but mortality even among first-born nestlings is much higher, in particular in the first weeks after hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-Watson_2-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Watson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Due to the defensive ferocity of the eagles, predation on the Golden Eagle is rare even with eggs and small nestlings. The only known predators of Golden Eagle nests are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine" title="Wolverine">wolverines</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" title="Brown bear">brown bears</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> Although a high percentage may die in their first year, Golden Eagles who survive to adulthood may live quite long. In some cases, wild eagles can live for 28 to 32 years and individuals in captivity have survived to an age of 46 years. Most adult mortality is now human-related. This can include collision with man-made objects, incidental poisoning from chemicals, lead or ingestion of poison meant for mammalian scavengers or from hunting or trapping.

The reasons for this are various, but among the nations that use the Golden Eagle as or in a state symbol, there are two clear traditions that help explain the modern usage. Among European countries, the Golden Eagle was the model for the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila_(Roman)" title="Aquila (Roman)">aquila</a></i>, the most prominent symbol of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_legion" title="Roman legion">Roman legions</a> and more generally the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Roman civilization</a> that had such a powerful impact on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture" title="Western culture">Western culture</a>; furthermore, some Roman traditions were carried on by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> in the Southern and Eastern of Europe and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> in Central and Western Europe, transmitting the use of the Golden Eagle to several modern states. This association of the Golden Eagle with Rome has also led to the adoption of similar symbols in other countries; for instance, the adoption of the related and physically similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_Eagle" title="Bald Eagle">Bald Eagle</a> as the national bird of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> was inspired by the conception of the United States as a modern reincarnation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a>, a theme that recurs in other elements as well (including the prevalence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture" title="Neoclassical architecture">neoclassical architecture</a> in American public buildings and the use of Roman terminology—such as naming the upper house of Congress the Senate—to hark back to the Roman model).
Another large tradition of using the Golden Eagle can be found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world" title="Arab world">Arab world</a>, where the eagle is historically a symbol of power in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_poetry" title="Arabic poetry">Arabic poetry</a>, and was according to legend the personal emblem of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin" title="Saladin">Saladin</a>. The specific depiction of Golden Eagle legendarily considered to be Saladin's was adopted by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism" title="Arab nationalism">Arab nationalist</a> movement, and currently appears on the arms of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Egypt" title="Coat of arms of Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Iraq" title="Coat of arms of Iraq">Iraq</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Palestinian_National_Authority" title="Coat of arms of the Palestinian National Authority">Palestine</a>; it had previously appeared on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emblem_of_Yemen" title="Emblem of Yemen">arms</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Democratic_Republic_of_Yemen" title="People's Democratic Republic of Yemen" class="mw-redirect">People's Democratic Republic of Yemen</a> (1967–1990) and on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Libya" title="Coat of arms of Libya">arms</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Arab_Republic" title="Libyan Arab Republic" class="mw-redirect">Libyan Arab Republic</a> (1970–1972). The current emblem of Yemen displays a Golden Eagle, but it is not that of Saladin.
The eagle is a sacred bird in some cultures and the feathers of the eagle are central to many religious and spiritual customs, especially among some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native Americans in the United States</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" title="First Nations">First Nations</a> in Canada, as well as among many of the peoples of Meso-America. Some Native American peoples revere eagles as sacred and the feathers and other parts of Bald and Golden Eagles. Feathers are often worn on Native American headdresses and have been compared to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifix" title="Crucifix">crucifix</a> of Christianity. Eagle feathers are often used in various Native ceremonies and are used to honour noteworthy achievements and qualities such as exceptional leadership and bravery.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from December 2010">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The Golden Eagle is thought to be the origin of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbird_(mythology)" title="Thunderbird (mythology)">Thunderbird</a> legends of the southwestern United States,<sup id="cite_ref-eagles_41-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-eagles-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup>
