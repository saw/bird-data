This roughly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_(bird)" title="Thrush (bird)">thrush</a>-sized bird measures 15–17&nbsp;cm in length and weighs 24–30 g. Its coloration is quite uniformly a rich <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut_brown" title="Chestnut brown" class="mw-redirect">chestnut brown</a>. The tail is darker, the breast, rump and head are lighter and tinged rufous, though the crown and cheek region are as dark as the body, with some greyish hue to the cheeks. Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" title="Iris (anatomy)">iris</a> is dusky brown, the feet are blackish brown. The bill is very long and thin, perhaps by proportion the longest and thinnest of all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furnariidae" title="Furnariidae" class="mw-redirect">Furnariidae</a>. It is blackish brown above, and whitish, horn-colored or dark grey below; the tip is black.<sup id="cite_ref-remsen2003a_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-remsen2003a-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Males and females look alike. Young birds are duller, with light streaks and dusky scaling on throat and breast.<sup id="cite_ref-remsen2003a_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-remsen2003a-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The song of the Tawny-throated Leaftosser is a series of 4–9 wheezy notes which descend, accelerate and fade out as they are given: <i>peeeeee-peeeee-peeee-chrrrr</i>. For some populations, slightly different songs have been described; subspecies <i>pullus</i> produces a series of sharp <i>squee</i> calls or a whistling <i>pseeer-pseer-pseer-psee-pse</i>, while subspecies <i>peruvianus</i> has a series of clear <i>suweet</i> whistles and its song often ends in a trill. It is not clear whether these vocalizations indicate specific distinctiveness, but it is notable that at least in <i>peruvianus</i> the song often ends with a "flourish" and does not quietly fade out as it does in the northern populations.<sup id="cite_ref-remsen2003a_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-remsen2003a-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The alarm call is a sharp <i>chick</i>, <i>squee</i>, <i>tseeéét</i> or <i>zick</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-remsen2003a_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-remsen2003a-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>

It looks almost alike but it has a shorter bill and its song, while structured similarly, changes in pitch several times through its course rather than simply descending. It is also an inhabitant of <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Terra_firme&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Terra firme (page does not exist)">terra firme</a></i> forest near rivers, whereas the Tawny-throated Leaftosser prefers hilly terrain.<sup id="cite_ref-remsen2003_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-remsen2003-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Tawny-throated Leaftosser is considered to be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_species" title="Sister species" class="mw-redirect">sister species</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-billed_Leaftosser" title="Short-billed Leaftosser">Short-billed Leaftosser</a> (<i>S. rufigularis</i>). It might actually contain two species which are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatric" title="Sympatric" class="mw-redirect">sympatric</a> by range (though not by altitude) between eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>; the birds between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Department" title="Meta Department">Meta</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santander_Department" title="Santander Department">Santander Departments</a> (Colombia), including a population in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serran%C3%ADa_de_las_Quinchas" title="Serranía de las Quinchas">Serranía de las Quinchas</a> discovered only on January 20, 2006, have not been identified as to subspecies yet.

The species is largely absent from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> and is patchily distributed across most of its range, particularly Central America. Its natural <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitats</a> are tropical moist lowland <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forests</a> and tropical moist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montane_forest" title="Montane forest" class="mw-redirect">montane evergreen forests</a>. It prefers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill" title="Hill">hilly</a> terrain, occurring mainly between 700 and 2,200 m <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level" title="Above mean sea level">ASL</a> in Central America, and from near sea level to 1,500 m and locally to 2,000 m ASL in South America.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The species lives on the ground, where it feeds on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> found by flicking through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_litter" title="Leaf litter" class="mw-redirect">leaf litter</a>, digging in moist soil or in rotting wood, often using the tail to anchor itself; the tips of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectrices" title="Rectrices" class="mw-redirect">rectrices</a> become abraded by this behavior and before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moult" title="Moult" class="mw-redirect">moult</a> often just the resilient feather shafts remain. Tawny-throated Leaftossers are encountered singly or in pairs; they may be attracted by recordings of their alarm calls. These birds typically move by hopping about and are reluctant to fly if they do not have to. They are not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-rc0307_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rc0307-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Tawny-throated Leaftossers are assumed to be monogamous and are territorial, with their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)" title="Territory (animal)">territories</a> that are around 25 ha in size. The breeding season – if this species actually has a well-marked breeding season – is prolonged, running at least from December to April in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>; breeding activity was recorded in April/May for Colombia and in August for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>. The nest is a small cup, loosely woven from dry twigs and leaf remains, in a cavity up to 20&nbsp;cm in diameter at the end of a tunnel – up to 50&nbsp;cm long but often much shorter – dug into an earth bank or similar spot. Little is known about their breeding biology, but they presumably lay two eggs per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)" title="Clutch (eggs)">clutch</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
It is generally an uncommon bird, with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density" title="Population density">population density</a> usually less than (and often far less than) 5 individuals per square kilometer. It quickly disappears from forests that have been fragmented due to logging, and will not even tolerate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_logging" title="Selective logging" class="mw-redirect">selective logging</a> well. Due to its large overall range, it is classified as a Species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern" title="Least Concern">Least Concern</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>; if it is split up into two or three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> however, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andean</a> and Atlantic Forest populations are likely to qualify as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_species" title="Threatened species">threatened species</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
