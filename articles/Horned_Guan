The <b>Horned Guan</b>, <i>Oreophasis derbianus</i> is a large, approximately 85&nbsp;cm long, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)" title="Turkey (bird)">turkey</a>-like bird with glossed black upperparts plumage, red legs, white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" title="Iris (anatomy)">iris</a>, yellow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> and a red horn on top of head. The breast and upper belly are white, and its long tail feathers are black with white band near base. Both sexes are similar. The young is duller with smaller horn, and has brown tail and wings.
The only member in monotypic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i>Oreophasis</i>, the Horned Guan is distributed in humid mountain forests of southeast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>-(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiapas" title="Chiapas">Chiapas</a>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>. It is found in altitude up to 3,350 metres. Its diet consists mainly of fruits, green leaves and invertebrates. The female usually lays up to two eggs.
The Horned Guan is not a true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guan_(bird)" title="Guan (bird)">guan</a>, but merely resembles these birds most in overall shape and color, whereas the horn is more reminiscent of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmeted_curassow" title="Helmeted curassow" class="mw-redirect">helmeted curassows</a>. In fact, this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> is the only survivor of a very ancient lineage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracidae" title="Cracidae">cracids</a> that has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolving</a> independently from all other living members of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> for at least 20, possibly as much as 40 million years.
Although it does not have any really close relatives among living cracids, the true guans are apparently most <i>distant</i>. Given that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)" title="Basal (phylogenetics)">basal</a> relationships of the living cracids are not well resolved, the Horned Guan is often placed into a distinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfamily" title="Subfamily" class="mw-redirect">subfamily</a>, the Oreophasinae. Alternatively, it might be included in a large Cracinae with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curassow" title="Curassow">curassows</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chachalaca" title="Chachalaca">chachalacas</a> (Pereira <i>et al.</i> 2002)
Due to ongoing habitat loss, small population size, limited range and hunting in some areas, the Horned Guan is evaluated as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered" title="Endangered" class="mw-redirect">Endangered</a> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List</a> of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES" title="CITES">CITES</a>.
