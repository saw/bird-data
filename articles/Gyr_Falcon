The Gyrfalcon breeds on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> coasts and the islands of North America, Europe, and Asia. It is mainly resident there also, but some Gyrfalcons <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">disperse</a> more widely after the breeding season, or in winter.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>nb 1<span>]</span></a></sup> The Gyrfalcon is dispersed throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere, with populations in Northern America, Greenland, and Northern Europe. Its plumage varies with location, with birds being coloured from all-white to dark brown. For centuries, gyrfalcon has been a precious hunting bird, highly valued among the Vikings. It is the national symbol of Iceland.
The bird's common name comes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French</a> <i>gerfaucon</i>; in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin" title="Medieval Latin">medieval Latin</a> it is <i>gyrofalco</i>. The first part of the word may come from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_High_German" title="Old High German">Old High German</a> <i>gîr</i> (cf. modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a> <i>Geier</i>) for "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulture" title="Vulture">vulture</a>", referring to its size compared to other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon" title="Falcon">falcons</a>; or from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>gȳrus</i> for "circle" or "curved path"—from the species' circling as it searches for prey, distinct from the hunting of other falcons in its range.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>nb 2<span>]</span></a></sup> The male Gyrfalcon is called a <b>gyrkin</b> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry" title="Falconry">falconry</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature" title="Binomial nomenclature">scientific name</a> is composed of the Latin term for a falcon, <i>Falco</i>, and for a countryside-dweller, <i>rusticolus</i>.
The gyrfalcon is a very large falcon, being about the same size as the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteo" title="Buteo">buteos</a> (buzzard hawks). Males are 48 to 61&nbsp;cm (19 to 24 in) long, weigh 805 to 1350 g (1.8 to 3&nbsp;lbs) and have a wingspan from 110 to 130&nbsp;cm (43 to 51 in). Females are bulkier and larger, at 51 to 65&nbsp;cm (20 to 26 in) long, 124 to 160&nbsp;cm (49 to 64 in) wingspan, and of 1180 to 2100 g (2.6 to 4.6&nbsp;lbs) weight. Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 34.5 to 41 cm (13.6 to 16 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail" title="Tail">tail</a> is 19.5 to 29 cm (7.7 to 11 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmen_(bird)" title="Culmen (bird)" class="mw-redirect">culmen</a> is 2 to 2.8 cm (0.79 to 1.1 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 4.9 to 7.5 cm (1.9 to 3.0 in).<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The Gyrfalcon is larger than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_Falcon" title="Peregrine Falcon">Peregrine Falcon</a> (which it is known to hunt) and differs from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzard" title="Buzzard">buzzard</a> in general structure, being unmistakably a falcon with pointed wings, and broader-winged and longer-tailed than the Peregrine.
The Gyrfalcon is a very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)" title="Polymorphism (biology)">polymorphic</a> species, so its plumage varies greatly. The archetypal morphs are called "white", "silver", "brown", and "black", though they can be coloured on a spectrum that begins with all-white and ends with very dark. The brown form of the Gyrfalcon is distinguished from the Peregrine by the cream streaking on the nape and crown and by the absence of a well-defined malar stripe and cap. The black morph has its underside strongly spotted black, rather than finely barred as in the Peregrine. White form Gyrfalcons are unmistakable, as they are the only predominantly white falcons. Silver gyrfalcons resemble a light grey <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanner_Falcon" title="Lanner Falcon">Lanner Falcon</a> of larger size. There is no difference in colouring between males and females; and juveniles are darker and browner than the corresponding adults.
The black color seems to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-linked" title="Sex-linked" class="mw-redirect">sex-linked</a> and to occur mostly in females; it proved difficult for breeders to get males darker than the dark side of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_grey" title="Slate grey" class="mw-redirect">slate grey</a>. A color variety that arose in captive breeding is "black chick".<sup id="cite_ref-falconscanada_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-falconscanada-5"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Gyrfalcon is a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierofalcon" title="Hierofalcon">hierofalcon</a> complex. In this group, there is ample evidence for rampant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybridisation</a> and incomplete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalescent_theory" title="Coalescent theory">lineage sorting</a> which confounds analyses of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence" title="Nucleic acid sequence">DNA sequence</a> data to a massive extent. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_(biology)" title="Radiation (biology)" class="mw-redirect">radiation</a> of the entire living diversity of hierofalcons took place in approximately the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eemian" title="Eemian">Eemian Stage</a> at the start of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Pleistocene" title="Late Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a>. It represents lineages that expanded into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holarctic" title="Holarctic">Holarctic</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(biology)" title="Adaptation (biology)" class="mw-redirect">adapted</a> to local conditions; this is in contrast to less northerly populations of northeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> (where the radiation probably originated) which evolved into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saker_Falcon" title="Saker Falcon">Saker Falcon</a>. Gyrfalcons hybridize not infrequently with Sakers in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_Mountains" title="Altai Mountains">Altai Mountains</a> and this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_flow" title="Gene flow">gene flow</a> seems to be the origin of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_Falcon" title="Altai Falcon">Altai Falcon</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
There is some correlation between locality and colour morph. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> Gyrfalcons are lightest, with white plumage flecked with grey on the back and wings being most common. Other subpopulations have varying amounts of the darker morphs: the Icelandic birds tend towards pale, whereas the Eurasian populations are considerably darker and typically incorporate no white birds. Natural separation into regional subspecies is prevented by Gyrfalcons' habit of flying long distances whilst exchanging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele" title="Allele">alleles</a> between subpopulations; thus, the allele distributions for the color polymorphism form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(biology)" title="Cline (biology)">clines</a> and in darker birds<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>nb 3<span>]</span></a></sup> of unknown origin, theoretically any allele combination might be present. For instance, a mating of a pair of captive Gyrfalcons is documented to have produced a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch" title="Clutch">clutch</a> of 4 young: one white, one silver, one brown, and one black.
In general, geographic variation follows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergmann%27s_Rule" title="Bergmann's Rule" class="mw-redirect">Bergmann's Rule</a> for size and the demands of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypsis" title="Crypsis">crypsis</a> for plumage coloration. Several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> have been named according to perceived differences between populations<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>nb 4<span>]</span></a></sup> but none of these are consistent and thus no living subspecies are accepted today. Perhaps the Icelandic population described as <i>Falco rusticolus islandus</i> is the most distinct. The predominantly white Arctic forms are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapatric_speciation" title="Parapatric speciation">parapatric</a> and seamlessly grade into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarctic" title="Subarctic">subarctic</a> populations, whereas the birds of Iceland have presumably less <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_flow" title="Gene flow">gene flow</a> with their neighbors and indeed show less variation in plumage colors and often look quite similar to a large, washed-out Peregrine Falcon (although their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">habitus</a> is different). Comprehensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogeography" title="Phylogeography">phylogeographic</a> studies to determine the proper status of the Icelandic population have yet to be determined.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
A recent molecular study,<sup id="cite_ref-Johnson_et_al._2007_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Johnson_et_al._2007-10"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> however, identified the Iceland population as genetically unique relative to other sampled populations in both eastern and western Greenland, Canada, Alaska and Norway. Further, within Greenland, differing levels of gene flow between western and eastern sampling locations was identified with apparent asymmetric dispersal in western Greenland from north to south. This dispersal bias is in agreement with the distribution of plumage colour variants with white Gyrfalcons in much higher proportion in northern Greenland.<sup id="cite_ref-Johnson_et_al._2007_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Johnson_et_al._2007-10"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Further work is required to determine the ecological factors contributing to these distributions relative to plumage differences, and whether renewed subspecies designations are warranted.
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronospecies" title="Chronospecies">paleosubspecies</a>, <i>Falco rusticolus swarthi</i>, existed during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Pleistocene" title="Late Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a> (125,000 to 13,000 years ago). Fossils found in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Little_Box_Elder_Cave&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Little Box Elder Cave (page does not exist)">Little Box Elder Cave</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_County,_Wyoming" title="Converse County, Wyoming">Converse County, Wyoming</a>), <a href="/w/index.php?title=Dark_Canyon_Cave&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dark Canyon Cave (page does not exist)">Dark Canyon Cave</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_County,_New_Mexico" title="Eddy County, New Mexico">Eddy County, New Mexico</a>), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKittrick,_California" title="McKittrick, California">McKittrick, California</a> were initially described as <i>Falco swarthi</i> ("Swarth Falcon" or more properly "Swarth's Gyrfalcon") on account of their distinct size. They have meanwhile proven to be largely inseparable from those of living Gyrfalcons, except for being somewhat larger.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
Swarth's Gyrfalcon was on the upper end of the present Gyrfalcon's size range, strong females even surpassing it (Miller 1935). It seems to have had some adaptations to the temperate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate" title="Semi-arid climate">semiarid</a> climate that predominated in its range during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation" title="Quaternary glaciation">last ice age</a>. Ecologically more similar to the Siberian populations of today (which are generally composed of smaller birds) or to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_Falcon" title="Prairie Falcon">Prairie Falcon</a>, this population of temperate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe" title="Steppe">steppe</a> habitat must have preyed on landbirds and mammals rather than the water—and on the seabirds which make up much of the American Gyrfalcon's diet today.
The Gyrfalcon was originally thought to be a bird of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a> and mountains only, however, in June 2011 it was revealed that it spends considerable periods during the winter on sea ice far from land.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> It feeds only on birds and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, the latter of which it takes more regularly than many other <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falco_(genus)" title="Falco (genus)" class="mw-redirect">Falco</a></i> species. Like other hierofalcons, it usually hunts in a horizontal pursuit, rather than with the peregrine's speedy stoop from a height. Most prey is killed on the ground, whether they are captured there or, if the victim is a flying bird, forced to the ground. The diet is to some extent opportunistic, but a majority of breeding birds mostly rely on <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagopus" title="Lagopus">Lagopus</a></i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grouse" title="Grouse">grouse</a> and avian marine species on coastal habitats. Avian prey can range in size from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redpoll" title="Redpoll">redpolls</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose" title="Goose">geese</a> and can include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gulls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvidae" title="Corvidae">corvids</a>, smaller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerines</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">waders</a>, and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">raptors</a> (up to the size of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteo" title="Buteo">Buteos</a></i>). Mammalian prey can range in size from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrew" title="Shrew">shrews</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot" title="Marmot">marmots</a> (sometimes thrice the weight of the assaulting falcon), and often includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemming" title="Lemming">lemmings</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vole" title="Vole">voles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_squirrel" title="Ground squirrel">ground squirrels</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare" title="Hare">hares</a>. They are rarely observed eating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion" title="Carrion">carrion</a>.
The Gyrfalcon almost invariably nests on cliff faces. Breeding pairs do not build their own nests, and often use a bare cliff ledge or the abandoned nest of other birds, particularly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Eagle" title="Golden Eagle">Golden Eagles</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Raven" title="Common Raven">Common Ravens</a>. The clutch can range from 1 to 5 eggs, but is usually 2 to 4. The average size of an egg is 58.46×45&nbsp;mm (2.31×1.8 in); the average weight is 62 g (2.2&nbsp;oz). The incubation period averages 35 days, with the chicks hatching at a weight of around 52 g (1.8&nbsp;oz). The nestlings are brooded usually for 10 to 15 days and leave the nest at 7 to 8 weeks. At 3 to 4 months of age, the immature gyrfalcons become independent of their parents, though they may associate with their siblings through the following winter.
The only natural predator of Gyrfalcons are Golden Eagles and even they rarely engage with these formidable falcons. Gyrfalcons have been recorded as aggressively harassing animals that come near their nests, although Common Ravens are the only predators known to successfully pick off Gyrfalcon eggs and hatchlings. Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" title="Brown bear">brown bears</a> have been reportedly dive-bombed. Humans, whether accidentally (automobile collisions or poisoning of carrion to kill <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammalian</a> scavengers) or intentionally (through hunting), are the leading cause of death for Gyrfalcons. Gyrfalcons that survive into adulthood can live up to 20 years of age.
As <i>F. rusticolus</i> has such a wide range, it is not considered a threatened species by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">IUCN</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> It is not much affected by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction">habitat destruction</a>, but pollution, for instance by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticides</a>, depressed its numbers in the mid-20th century, and until 1994 it was considered "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Threatened" title="Near Threatened">Near Threatened</a>". Improving environmental standards in developed countries have allowed the birds to make a comeback, and today they are not considered rare or endangered.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Gyrfalcon has long associated with humans, who have found them useful primarily for hunting and the art of falconry. It is today the official bird of Canada's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territories" title="Northwest Territories">Northwest Territories</a>. The white falcon in the crest of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Icelandic Republic</a>'s coat of arms is a variety of Gyrfalcon.
In the medieval era, the Gyrfalcon was considered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch" title="Monarch">royal</a> bird. The geographer and historian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Said_al-Maghribi" title="Ibn Said al-Maghribi">Ibn Said al-Maghribi</a> (d. 1286) described certain northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> islands west of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> where these falcons would be brought from, and how the Egyptian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan" title="Sultan">Sultan</a> paid 1,000 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinar" title="Dinar">dinars</a> for each Gyrfalcon (or, if it arrived dead, 500 dinars).<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Due to its rarity and the difficulties involved in obtaining it, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry" title="Falconry">falconry</a> the Gyrfalcon was reserved for kings and nobles; very rarely was a man of lesser rank seen with a Gyrfalcon on his fist.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
In the 12th century AD China, swan-hunting with Gyrfalcons (海东青 <i>hǎidōngqīng</i> in Chinese) obtained from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurchen_people" title="Jurchen people">Jurchen</a> tribes became fashionable among the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitan_people" title="Khitan people">Khitan</a> nobility. When demand for Gyrfalcons exceeded supply, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liao_Dynasty" title="Liao Dynasty">Liao Emperor</a> imposed a tax payment-in-kind of Gyrfalcons on the Jurchen; under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Tianzuo_of_Liao" title="Emperor Tianzuo of Liao">last Liao emperor</a>, tax collectors were entitled to use force to procure sufficient Gyrfalcons.

Gyrfalcons are today expensive to buy, and thus owners and breeders may keep them secret to avoid theft. They can and often do fly long distances, and falconers may fit a radio-tracker to aid recovery.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Wild Gyrfalcons are not much exposed to disease, and as a result have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system" title="Immune system">immune systems</a> that are naive to many avian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogens" title="Pathogens" class="mw-redirect">pathogens</a> found around human environments.

Falcons are known to be very susceptible to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza" title="Avian influenza">avian influenza</a>. Therefore an experiment was done with hybrid gyr-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saker_Falcon" title="Saker Falcon">saker</a> falcons, which found that 5 falcons vaccinated with a commercial H5N2 influenza vaccine survived infection with a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, whereas 5 unvaccinated falcons died. Since both wild and captive gyrfalcons are valuable (for wildlife conservation and falconry, respectively), this means they can be protected from bird flu by vaccination.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
