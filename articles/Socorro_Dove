<i>Zenaida macroura graysoni</i>
The <b>Socorro Dove</b> (<i>Zenaida graysoni</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dove" title="Dove" class="mw-redirect">dove</a> that is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_in_the_wild" title="Extinct in the wild" class="mw-redirect">extinct in the wild</a>. It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)" title="Endemic (ecology)" class="mw-redirect">endemic</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socorro_Island" title="Socorro Island">Socorro Island</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revillagigedo_Islands" title="Revillagigedo Islands">Revillagigedo Islands</a> off the west coast of Mexico. The last sighting in its natural habitat was in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_in_science" title="1972 in science">1972</a>. There are not more than 200 and probably fewer than 100 purebred birds in captivity. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reintroduction" title="Reintroduction">reintroduction program</a> is in the early stages of preparation.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
It is a close relative of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mourning_Dove" title="Mourning Dove">Mourning</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eared_Dove" title="Eared Dove">Eared Doves</a>, particularly the former<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and was at one time considered its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>. In captivity, it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybridizes</a> vigorously with the former and almost all privately-owned birds as well as several of the captive breeding programs that lack a pedigree are known or strongly suspected to be such hybrids. They are excluded from the reintroduction program as there is evidence of unique <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation" title="Adaptation">adaptations</a> in the Socorro species. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_name" title="Scientific name" class="mw-redirect">scientific name</a> commemorates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%A9na%C3%AFde_Laetitia_Julie_Bonaparte" title="Zénaïde Laetitia Julie Bonaparte">Zénaïde Laetitia Julie Bonaparte</a> and the American ornithologist and artist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson_Grayson" title="Andrew Jackson Grayson">Andrew Jackson Grayson</a>.
The Socorro Dove is a medium-sized, principally terrestrial dove with long legs for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenaida_dove" title="Zenaida dove" class="mw-redirect">Zenaida dove</a>. It is 26.5–34&nbsp;cm long and weighs 190 g on average. In overall color pattern, it agrees with its relatives. It is considered to be a stronger-colored insular representative of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mourning_Dove" title="Mourning Dove">Mourning Dove</a>. The male is deep cinnamon on its head and underparts, with an ear streak like its relatives. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nape" title="Nape">nape</a> is blue-grey and the neck has an iridescent pink patch, most prominent after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moult" title="Moult" class="mw-redirect">moult</a>. The upperparts are rufous brown. Female and juvenile coloration is slightly duller. The most conspicuous differences from the Mourning Dove - darker coloration and more well-developed feet - were useful amid the dark <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava" title="Lava">lava</a> rock and the shady forests of its island home, where native <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammalian</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator" class="mw-redirect">predators</a> were absent but constant threats from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Hawk" title="Red-tailed Hawk">Red-tailed Hawks</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Frigatebird" title="Great Frigatebird">Great Frigatebirds</a> were present.<sup id="cite_ref-b.26h1956_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-b.26h1956-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The advertising call begins with a disyllabic coo, followed by three single calls, and ends with another disyllabic coo: <i>"Coo-oo, OO, OO, OO, Coo-oo"</i>. Each of these 5 elements takes a little less than one second.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arid" title="Arid">arid</a> and fairly barren <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clari%C3%B3n_Island" title="Clarión Island" class="mw-redirect">Clarión Island</a>, some 400&nbsp;km (250&nbsp;mi) west of Socorro, has an endemic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> of the Mourning Dove, <i>Zenaida macroura clarionensis</i>. These birds are roughly intermediate in appearance between the Socorro Dove and the mainland Mourning Doves. It is highly likely that they represent a later colonization by Mourning Doves (rather than "proto-Mourning Dove" stock), which evolved its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype" title="Phenotype">phenotype</a> independently from but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_evolution" title="Parallel evolution">in parallel</a> with the Socorro birds.<sup id="cite_ref-b.26h1956_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-b.26h1956-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> This would mean that predation by Great Frigatebirds is significant enough to select towards a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypsis" title="Crypsis">cryptic</a> darkening of the plumage, as these are the only predators of <i>Z. m. clarionensis</i>. On a semidesert island such as Clarión, birds would be expected to evolve towards lighter plumage - to better withstand the heat and lack of reliable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater" title="Freshwater" class="mw-redirect">freshwater</a> sources - in accordance with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloger%27s_Rule" title="Gloger's Rule" class="mw-redirect">Gloger's Rule</a>.
There is marked behavioral difference to the Mourning Dove. When Andrew Jackson Grayson discussed the species, he called it the "Solitary Dove" because he never saw more than one male and one female together. The doves, particularly the adult males, chase away their young as soon as these can fend for their own and the partners split for the time being. This too is believed to be in adaptation to the former dominance of aerial predators, lest local concentrations of birds, let alone young, unexperienced ones, would present easy targets for the hawks. Typical of many birds on mammal-less islands, Socorro Doves <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_tameness" title="Island tameness">show little fear of humans</a> or, fatally, cats.<sup id="cite_ref-schmechel2006_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-schmechel2006-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The last <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a> in which this dove was found is the low seasonally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid" title="Humid" class="mw-redirect">humid</a> forest above 500 m <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level" title="Above mean sea level">ASL</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-bli2007_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bli2007-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Before the introduction of cats, it seasonally descended into the lowlands where it was "common" in March 1953 for example. It may be that this coincided with the peak of the breeding season, when many birds had dependent young and dispersed widely to gather more varied food. This was the case in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socorro_Mockingbird" title="Socorro Mockingbird">Socorro Mockingbird</a>, the other mid-sized native landbird of Socorro, which apparently has very similar habitat preferences.<sup id="cite_ref-b.26h1956_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-b.26h1956-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Its last refuge was dominated by endemic <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Guettarda_insularis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Guettarda insularis (page does not exist)">Guettarda insularis</a></i>, <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Ilex_socorroensis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ilex socorroensis (page does not exist)">Ilex socorroensis</a></i> and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideroxylon_socorrense" title="Sideroxylon socorrense">Sideroxylon socorrense</a></i>, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prunus_serotina" title="Prunus serotina">Black Cherry</a> (<i>Prunus serotina</i><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>), <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Ficus_cotinifolia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ficus cotinifolia (page does not exist)">Ficus cotinifolia</a></i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig_tree" title="Fig tree" class="mw-redirect">fig trees</a> and <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Psidium_socorrense&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Psidium socorrense (page does not exist)">Psidium socorrense</a></i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guava" title="Guava">guavas</a>, apparently all native on Socorro.

It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frugivorous" title="Frugivorous" class="mw-redirect">frugivorous</a> and, as is often the case in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae" title="Columbidae">Columbidae</a>, might have played an important role in the reproduction of the trees which dominate its habitat. One of these (<i>S. socorrense</i>) is classified as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species" title="Vulnerable species">Vulnerable</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> In particular, it was found to associate with the fig trees.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
Virtually nothing is known about breeding in the wild. Parallels in altitudinal migration with the equally solitary mockingbird might be taken as indication that the breeding activity peaked around March–April. In captivity, the female generally lays two white eggs in a nestbox 1-2.5 m above ground. The incubation lasts 14–17 days. The young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> after 14–20 days.<sup id="cite_ref-schmechel2006_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-schmechel2006-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Socorro Dove is thought to have been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extirpate" title="Extirpate" class="mw-redirect">extirpated</a> mainly by feral <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" title="Cat">cats</a>, but high levels of understorey grazing by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep" title="Sheep">sheep</a> may have limited the population. Human hunting might have temporarily brought down numbers, though little permanent settlement exists on Socorro. Cats were introduced apparently in the early 1970s. They do not seem to have been present in 1953.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
The species reproduces no less willingly in captivity than other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenaida_doves" title="Zenaida doves"><i>Zenaida</i> doves</a>, provided its different ecological needs are addressed. Most of the surviving birds are in zoos and other facilities in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">USA</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-schmechel2006_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-schmechel2006-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> On October 30, 2006, the Socorro Dove was successfully bred at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Zoo" title="London Zoo">London Zoo</a>. The bird was named "Arnie", after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, with reference to his famous line "I'll be back" (on Socorro Island). However when Arnie was sexed he turned out to be a she. It is hoped that the descendants of Arnie and her relatives can someday soon be reintroduced into the wild. As of early 2006, it was being prepared to remove the sheep and to rid the island of cats. In the meantime, with the maintenance of the remaining birds, stock for reintroduction is being provided.<sup id="cite_ref-schmechel2006_4-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-schmechel2006-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
