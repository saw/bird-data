The <b>Cassin’s Auklet</b> (<i>Ptychoramphus aleuticus</i>) is a small, chunky <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> that ranges widely in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific" title="North Pacific" class="mw-redirect">North Pacific</a>. It nests in small burrows and because of its presence on well studied <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island" title="Island">islands</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> and off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> it is one of the better known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auk" title="Auk">auks</a>. It is named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassin" title="John Cassin">John Cassin</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> businessman and naturalist.
The Cassin's Auklet is a small (25&nbsp;cm, 200 g) nondescript auk. Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> is generally dark above and pale below, with a small white mark above the eye. Its bill is overall dark with a pale spot, and its feet are blue. Unlike many other auks the Cassin's Auklet lacks dramatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed" title="Breed">breeding</a> plumage, remaining the same over most of the year. At sea it is usually identified by its flight, which is described as looking like a flying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis" title="Tennis">tennis</a> ball. The Cassin's Auklet ranges from midway up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California_peninsula" title="Baja California peninsula">Baja California peninsula</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleutian_Islands" title="Aleutian Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>, off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. It nests on offshore islands, with the main population stronghold being <a href="/w/index.php?title=Triangle_Island&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Triangle Island (page does not exist)">Triangle Island</a> off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Island" title="Vancouver Island">Vancouver Island</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Scott_Provincial_Park" title="Cape Scott Provincial Park">Cape Scott</a>, where the population is estimated to be around 550,000 pairs. It is not known to be migratory, however northern birds may move farther south during the winter.
An extinct relative or predecessor species, <i>Ptychoramphus tenuis</i>, is known from the Late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene" title="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Formation" title="San Diego Formation">San Diego Formation</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>.
The Cassin's Auklet nests in burrows on small islands, and in the southern area of its range may be found in the breeding colony year round. It either digs holes in the soil or uses natural cracks and crevices to nest in, also readily using man-made structures. Pairs will show a strong loyalty towards each other and to a nesting site for many years. Both the parents <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubate</a> the single white egg, returning to swap shifts at night (usually after 2300 h) to avoid being taken by predators such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Gull" title="Western Gull">Western Gull</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_Falcon" title="Peregrine Falcon">Peregrine Falcon</a>. They also depart from the colony before dawn. The egg is incubated for 40 days, the small chick is then fed nightly for 35 days by both parents, who regurgitate partially digested food (euphausiids and other small crustaceans) carried in a special <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gular_pouch" title="Gular pouch" class="mw-redirect">gular pouch</a>, often referred to in the literature as a <a href="/w/index.php?title=Sublingual_pouch&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sublingual pouch (page does not exist)">sublingual pouch</a>. The chick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledges</a> alone and makes its way to the sea. The Cassin's Auklet is unusual amongst seabirds in occasionally laying a second clutch after a successful first clutch (it is the only northern hemisphere seabird to do so).
At sea Cassin's Auklets feeds offshore, in clear often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic" title="Pelagic" class="mw-redirect">pelagic</a> water, often associating with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathymetry" title="Bathymetry">bathymetric</a> landmarks such as <a href="/w/index.php?title=Underwater_canyon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Underwater canyon (page does not exist)">underwater canyons</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwelling" title="Upwelling">upwellings</a>. Numbers at sea may be grossly underestimated because the bird moves away from ships at a distance of more than a kilometer. Recently their distribution around Triangle Island has been determined by telemetry. It feeds by diving underwater beating its wings for propulsion, hunting down large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooplankton" title="Zooplankton">zooplankton</a>, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill" title="Krill">krill</a>. It can dive to 30 m below the surface, and by some estimates 80 m.
The Cassin's Auklet is listed as Least Concern; although some populations (principally the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Islands" title="Farallon Islands">Farallon Islands</a> population) have suffered steep declines, overall the species is still numerous. Threats to the auklet include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species" title="Introduced species">introduced</a> carnivores (particularly in Alaska), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_spill" title="Oil spill">oil spills</a> and changes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature" title="Sea surface temperature">sea surface temperature</a> (caused by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o" title="El Niño" class="mw-redirect">El Niño</a> events). The Cassin’s Auklet is protected under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act_of_1918" title="Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a>.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/intrnltr/mbta/mbtandx.html">[1]</a>
