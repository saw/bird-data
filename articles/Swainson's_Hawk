<i>Buteo swainsonii</i> <small>(<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapsus" title="Lapsus">lapsus</a></i>)</small>
<b>Swainson's Hawk</b> (<i>Buteo swainsoni</i>), is a large <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteo" title="Buteo">Buteo</a></i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawk</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconiformes" title="Falconiformes">Falconiformes</a>, sometimes separated in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipitriformes" title="Accipitriformes">Accipitriformes</a> like its relatives.

Their breeding habitat is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie" title="Prairie">prairie</a> and dry grasslands in western North America. They build a stick nest in a tree or shrub or on a cliff edge. This species is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">long-distance migrant</a>, wintering in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>; there is a single record of a vagrant from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a><sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs clarification or removal of jargon from April 2012">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup>.
This species or its immediate predecessor is the ancestor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Hawk" title="Galápagos Hawk" class="mw-redirect">Galápagos Hawk</a>, as demonstrated by recent research.

Swainson's Hawk is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">raptor</a> and a medium-sized member of the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteo" title="Buteo">Buteo</a></i> genus. It broadly overlaps in size with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Hawk" title="Red-tailed Hawk">Red-tailed Hawk</a> (<i>B. jamaicensis</i>), a related species found as a breeding resident almost throughout <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. Swainson's Hawk is on average a little shorter in length, 43–56 cm (17–22 in) long, and weighs a bit less, 0.5–1.7 kg (1.1–3.7 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> However, Swainson's Hawk has a slightly longer wingspan at 117–137 cm (46–54 in), with more slender, elongated wings, than the Red-tailed Hawk.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Female Swainson's Hawks, at an average weight of 1.15&nbsp;kg (2.5&nbsp;lb), are somewhat larger and heavier than males, at an average of 0.81&nbsp;kg (1.8&nbsp;lb).<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 36.2–42.7 cm (14.3–16.8 in), the tail is 18.5–23.4 cm (7.3–9.2 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 6.2–8 cm (2.4–3.1 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> (from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gape" title="Gape">gape</a>) is 3–3.5 cm (1.2–1.4 in).<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> In flight, Swainson's Hawk holds its wings in a slight <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_angle" title="Dihedral angle">dihedral</a>; it tips back and forth slightly while soaring.
There are two main color variations. Over 90% of individuals are light-morph; the dark morph is most common in the far west of the range:<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
Swainson's Hawk inhabits North America mainly in the spring and summer and winters in South America. Breeding areas include south-central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta" title="Alberta">Alberta</a>, central Saskatchewan, southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, and west and southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>. They will breed as far north as east-central Alaska, and southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon" title="Yukon">Yukon</a>. Breeding continues south through the eastern parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(U.S._state)" title="Washington (U.S. state)" class="mw-redirect">Washington</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon" title="Oregon">Oregon</a>, locally to the central valley of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>, New Mexico, Colorado, and most of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>. The eastern part of its range includes Minnesota, northwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa" title="Iowa">Iowa</a>, most of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska" title="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma" title="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, and all but eastern Texas. It periodically occurs in Iowa and rarely in northwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>, northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>, and southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>.
Small populations winter in southeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> and along the Texas coast, probably having failed to find the way south around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. Individuals reported north of these areas in winter (for example, on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Bird_Count" title="Christmas Bird Count">Christmas Bird Counts</a>) are almost invariably misidentified buteos of other species. Immature Swainson's hawks winter on the pampas of South America in Argentina, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, and southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>. It is not known with certainty where most of the adults spend the winter.
Swainson's Hawk is probably the longest migrant of any North American raptor. The flight from breeding ground to South American pampas in southern Brazil or Argentina can be as long as 14,000 miles (22,400&nbsp;km). Each migration can last at least two months.
They leave the breeding grounds from August to October. Fall migration begins each clear day on which a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind" title="Wind">wind</a> blows in the general direction of travel. Birds gain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude" title="Altitude">altitude</a> by soaring in circles on a rising <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal" title="Thermal">thermal</a> and then set their wings and close their tails as they glide, slowly losing altitude until they find another thermal and rise with it. Thus, waves and small groups are strung out across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky" title="Sky">sky</a>.
The birds gradually head southwards toward Central America where virtually the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population" title="Population">population</a> funnels through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus_of_Panama" title="Isthmus of Panama">Isthmus of Panama</a>. Concentrations over locations like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancon_Hill" title="Ancon Hill">Ancon Hill</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balboa,_Panama" title="Balboa, Panama">Balboa</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_City" title="Panama City">Panama City</a> are spectacular. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a>, it migrates along a narrow corridor and rarely strays off course; for example, it was only recorded in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serran%C3%ADa_de_las_Quinchas" title="Serranía de las Quinchas">Serranía de las Quinchas</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> – just 100&nbsp;km or so off its usual migration route – in 2000/2001.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
In Brazil, migrating birds pass through the western states of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre_(state)" title="Acre (state)">Acre</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mato_Grosso" title="Mato Grosso">Mato Grosso</a>, while wintering birds may stray to the southern states of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paran%C3%A1_(state)" title="Paraná (state)">Paraná</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul" title="Rio Grande do Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(state)" title="São Paulo (state)">São Paulo</a>. But surprisingly, the occasional Swainson's Hawk – including birds one or two years of age – has also been recorded in the eastern states of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maranh%C3%A3o" title="Maranhão">Maranhão</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par%C3%A1" title="Pará">Pará</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernambuco" title="Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piau%C3%AD" title="Piauí">Piauí</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocantins_(state)" title="Tocantins (state)" class="mw-redirect">Tocantins</a>, thousands of kilometers away from their usual migration route and wintering grounds and sometimes in mid-summer. This suggests that individuals occasionally become lost during migration, and/or that they may spend a whole year in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical" title="Tropical" class="mw-redirect">tropical</a> regions and range about, rather than just overwintering at one site.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
In Uruguay, the first dedicated studies show it to be not uncommon but patchily distributed across the country in winter. Notably, it had been underreported in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flores_Department" title="Flores Department">Flores</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paysand%C3%BA_Department" title="Paysandú Department">Paysandú Departments</a>, where it seems in fact to be a regular visitor. In recent years, the first birds were seen in early November, and some stayed til late February. Numbers increase throughout November and peak in December, when flocks of many dozen roam the open lands. But many stay only for a scant few weeks before leaving again.<sup id="cite_ref-am2008_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-am2008-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Spring migration broadens once the birds have passed through Mexico as they disperse through the breeding range. Migrant groups are noted in the southern U.S. states in March. The earliest Swainson's Hawks arrive in southern Canada in late March, with migration peaking from mid April onwards.
The habitat of Swainson's Hawk consists of open and semi-open country – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert" title="Desert">deserts</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland" title="Grassland">grasslands</a> and prairies – in both its breeding and wintering ranges. It favors wild prairie, hayfields, and pastures over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> fields and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfalfa" title="Alfalfa">alfalfa</a> fields, which may offer its prey too much cover. It requires elevated perches for hunting and a supply of small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a> such as young ground <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel" title="Squirrel">squirrels</a> as prey for its nestlings. The breeding distribution of Swainson's Hawk is tied very closely to the distribution of various small mammals for this reason. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, for example, the distribution of Richardson's Ground Squirrel and Swainson's Hawk are precisely the same.
Swainson's Hawk will defend its breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)" title="Territory (animal)">territory</a> from other buteos. Breeding densities may vary from one area to the next but averages one pair per 2.5 square miles (6.5&nbsp;km²). The average home range estimate for this hawk is 1 to 2 square miles (2.5 to 5&nbsp;km²). It gathers in groups for feeding and migrating. However, in each case, such gathering is not social, but motivated by good feeding or migrating conditions.
Swainson's Hawk, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Hawk" title="Red-tailed Hawk">Red-tailed Hawk</a> (<i>B. jamaicensis</i>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferruginous_Hawk" title="Ferruginous Hawk">Ferruginous Hawk</a> (<i>B. regalis</i>) compete for territory, and defend territories against each other. In many parts of the plains these three species nest in the same general area and exploit much the same prey base. Although diets overlap greatly, habitats may not overlap as much. In Oregon, Swainson's Hawk selects nesting trees having a different configuration than those used by Red-tailed or Ferruginous Hawks. In southern Alberta, different nesting habitats help reduce food competition, with Swainson's Hawk favoring areas with scattered trees or riparian borders, while Red-tailed Hawks nest in stands of tall trees, and Ferruginous Hawks nest on the open plains.
Reduced reproductive success may result from Swainson's Hawk's nesting proximity to these two other buteos. Swainson's Hawk is generally tolerant of people. The bird is attracted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haying" title="Haying" class="mw-redirect">haying</a>, mowing, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillage" title="Tillage">plowing</a> operations. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Sparrow" title="House Sparrow">House Sparrows</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Starling" title="European Starling" class="mw-redirect">European Starlings</a>, and other small birds may nest in or near a Swainson's Hawk's nest.
In winter quarters, they are far more tolerant, though many birds will still fend for themselves. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, the species likes largely open but broken (with rocks or woods) plains or low hills, where it can be seen to gather in larger groups. Groups of a few dozen birds are not uncommon. Flocks of over one hundred birds have been recorded several times, e.g. one that roamed the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Cuchilla_Marincho&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Cuchilla Marincho (page does not exist)">Cuchilla Marincho</a> region south of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Andresito&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Andresito (page does not exist)">Andresito</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flores_Department" title="Flores Department">Flores Department</a>) in mid-late December 2005.<sup id="cite_ref-am2008_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-am2008-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Swainson's Hawks hunt using various methods. Many still-hunt, watching for prey activity from a perch such as a tree, bush, pylon, telephone pole, hummock or other high object.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Others hunt by soaring over open ground with wings held in a dihedral, using their stellar vision to watch for prey activity below. It occasionally courses low over the ground like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Harrier" title="Northern Harrier" class="mw-redirect">Northern Harrier</a> (<i>Circus cyaneus</i>) or hovers like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough-legged_Hawk" title="Rough-legged Hawk" class="mw-redirect">Rough-legged Hawk</a> (<i>B. lagopus</i>) while hunting. They frequently engage in transect-glides while actively hunting in flight.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> It commonly perches on the ground both during migration and on the breeding grounds. While hunting on the ground, almost entirely for large insects, their gait can appear awkward but they are often successful in pinning down several insects per day.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> During migration, it typically roosts for the night on bare ground with scattered trees, a habit that distinguishes it from fellow long-distance migrants such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-winged_Hawk" title="Broad-winged Hawk">Broad-winged Hawk</a> (<i>B. platypterus</i>), which roosts in closed-canopy woodlands.
These birds patrol open areas or scan for prey from a perch; they may also catch insects in flight. They take advantage of insects turned up by farm equipment or driven out by fire. A hunting Swainson's Hawk will use several strategies. It hunts insects such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly" title="Dragonfly">dragonflies</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobsonfly" title="Dobsonfly">dobsonflies</a> while in flight, flapping little as it rides a wind current and stoops upon a fly, grabbing it with its foot and immediately transferring the prey to its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a>. It uses a similar strategy to grab individual free-tailed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat" title="Bat">bats</a> from flying streams of bats. Also, when dragonfly hordes are grounded by weather, Swainson's Hawk will stand near groups sheltering from the wind and pluck at individual insects. Swainson's Hawk closely follows both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractor" title="Tractor">tractors</a> and wild fires for injured or fleeing food. It will also run down insect prey on the ground. Occasionally a hawk will stand still on a dirt bank or elevated mound waiting for prey to appear. It commonly hunts from elevated perches such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_pole" title="Telephone pole" class="mw-redirect">telephone poles</a>, stooping on prey when it is sighted.
Swainson's Hawks may be largely insectivorous except when nesting. Insect prey commonly taken includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper" title="Grasshopper">grasshoppers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket" title="Cricket">crickets</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust" title="Locust">locusts</a>. Other <i>Buteo</i> hawks in this species range, including smaller-bodied species, do not normally prefer insects in their diet but instead focus on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent" title="Rodent">rodents</a> and other small vertebrates.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> However, breeding birds switch mainly to capturing vertebrate prey, which pairs then bring to their nestlings. Breeding Swainson's Hawks rely heavily upon small mammals such as young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_squirrel" title="Ground squirrel">ground squirrels</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottontail_rabbit" title="Cottontail rabbit">young cottontails</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_gopher" title="Pocket gopher">pocket gophers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mice" title="Mice" class="mw-redirect">mice</a>, young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackrabbit" title="Jackrabbit" class="mw-redirect">jackrabbits</a>, and, at least locally, small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a> and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a> including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile" title="Reptile">reptiles</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian" title="Amphibian">amphibians</a>. Birds taken include large birds such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallard" title="Mallard">Mallards</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_Grouse" title="Sage Grouse">Sage Grouse</a> which may have been injured initially.
Other unusual bird species taken include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Kestrel" title="American Kestrel">American Kestrel</a>, and young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-eared_Owl" title="Short-eared Owl">Short-eared Owls</a>. More typical in size are young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lark_Bunting" title="Lark Bunting">Lark Buntings</a> taken at their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledging</a> time. Reptiles, which can comprise large parts of a diet, include snakes such as racers, gopher snakes and striped <a href="/w/index.php?title=Whipsnake&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Whipsnake (page does not exist)">whipsnakes</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard" title="Lizard">lizards</a>. Amphibians may include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_salamander" title="Tiger salamander" class="mw-redirect">tiger salamanders</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toad" title="Toad">toads</a>. Swainson's Hawk is an opportunistic feeder which responds quickly to local concentrations of food.
In Argentina, flocks of immature Swainson's Hawks feed on flocks of the migratory <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darner" title="Darner" class="mw-redirect">darner</a> dragonfly <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Rhionaeschna_bonariensis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Rhionaeschna bonariensis (page does not exist)">Rhionaeschna bonariensis</a></i>, following the hordes of insects and feeding mostly on the wing. Local outbreaks of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust" title="Locust">locusts</a> may also be exploited for food by one or more age-classes of birds. The immatures wintering in southern Florida apparently feed upon either insects, mice, or both, when turned up from field plowing. They move from one freshly ploughed field to the next.
There is also some evidence that road-killed birds and animals are also consumed both on the wintering grounds and on the breeding grounds. The species commonly follows tractors and other agricultural equipment during haying or ploughing, where rodents are exposed for the hawks to capture, or insects are uncovered after crop cutting. Wildfires often attract foraging Swainson's Hawks, especially grass fires in their South American wintering range. In South American grass fires, the hawks frequently wait around the edges of the fire, picking off not only insects but also vertebrates including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothura" title="Nothura">nothuras</a>, lizards and snakes.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_3-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
When Swainson's Hawks arrive at their nesting sites in March or April, they may return to their original nests as these hawks are noted to be monogamous. Research indicates that they have a high degree of mate and territorial fidelity. This is unusual in a long-distance migrant. Seven to 15 days after the birds arrive, the males begin constructing nests on the ground, ledges or in a trees. The nest consists of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twig" title="Twig">twigs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass" title="Grass">grasses</a> and can take up to two weeks to complete. New nests may be constructed, old nests refurbished, or abandoned nests of other species – namely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvid" title="Corvid" class="mw-redirect">corvids</a><sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> – are refurbished.
The courtship displays of Swainson's Hawk are not well known. One activity involves circling and diving above a potential nest site. The underwings and rump are flashed and the birds call. The display may end with one bird diving to land on the edge of the nest. Copulation occurs mainly in the morning and evening on the dead limbs of trees. The female may assume the receptive position without a prior display. During treading one of the birds calls.
Swainson's Hawks typically nest in isolated trees or bushes, shelterbelts, riparian groves, or around abandoned homesteads. Occasionally, a pair will nest on the ground or on a bank or ledge. Nest trees and bushes include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponderosa_pine" title="Ponderosa pine" class="mw-redirect">ponderosa pine</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas-fir" title="Douglas-fir">Douglas-fir</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce" title="Spruce">spruce</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus_sect._Aegiros" title="Populus sect.

Nests are located from nine to 15 feet above the ground, often in the shaded canopy but near the top of the tree. Nests are flimsy structures, usually smaller than the nests of the Red-tailed Hawk, and often blow down after nesting season.
Clutch size ranges from one to four eggs, but averages two to three. Each egg is elliptical in shape, about 2.25&nbsp;inches (57&nbsp;mm) long and 1.8&nbsp;inches (46&nbsp;mm) wide. The egg is smooth with fine granulations and the ground color is white, often tinted bluish or greenish. During <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubation</a> the shell color quickly wears to dull white. Some eggs are plain; others are lightly marked with spots and blotches of light brown. The incubation period is 34 to 35 days, with the female incubating while the male brings food.
Young Swainson's Hawks are fed small, young mammals. Flight feathers begin to emerge on the young at nine to 11 days. High nestling mortality often occurs when the young are 15 to 30 days old and may be a result of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fratricide" title="Fratricide">fratricide</a>. The young begin to leave the nest for surrounding branches at 33 to 37 days, fledging occurs at about 38 to 46 days. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledgling_(birds)" title="Fledgling (birds)" class="mw-redirect">fledglings</a> are dependent upon their parents for four to 5 weeks. This species has one brood a year and apparently does not lay replacement clutches.
The oldest wild Swainson's Hawk on record is 24 years. Swainson's Hawks die because of collisions with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic" title="Traffic">traffic</a>, illegal shooting, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_shock" title="Electric shock">electrocution</a>, and even during severe prairie weather such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail" title="Hail">hailstorms</a>. Wind storms and hail caused 30 percent nest failure in one study. When sharing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grove_(nature)" title="Grove (nature)">grove</a> with nesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Horned_Owl" title="Great Horned Owl">Great Horned Owls</a>, the hawks suffer much egg loss due to owl predation. The species also suffers from frequent, unexplained egg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility" title="Infertility">infertility</a>.
Swainson's Hawk has suffered population declines since the first half of the century and was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-listed" title="Blue-listed">Blue-listed</a> in the United States from 1972 to 1982. It has since been placed on the <a href="/w/index.php?title=National_Audubon%27s_List_of_Special_Concern&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="National Audubon's List of Special Concern (page does not exist)">National Audubon's List of Special Concern</a> in 1986. It is now listed by the United States <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_and_Wildlife_Service" title="Fish and Wildlife Service" class="mw-redirect">Fish and Wildlife Service</a> as a Category 3C candidate. It should be noted that Swainson's Hawk was removed from the active Federal list because it was found to be more abundant than previously thought; it is not considered a threatened species by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> It remains listed as a threatened species by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Fish_and_Game" title="California Department of Fish and Game">California Department of Fish and Game</a> as it has been since 1983.
A major cause of Swainson's Hawk population decline was pesticide use in its wintering grounds of Argentina. Farmers there were using pesticides (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">DDT</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocrotophos" title="Monocrotophos">monocrotophos</a>) to control <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper" title="Grasshopper">grasshopper</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust" title="Locust">locust</a> infestations, and Swainson's Hawks were ingesting these pesticides in several different ways, but mainly by gorging themselves on the insects as they lay dying. The U.S. has worked with Argentine farmers to resolve this problem.<sup id="cite_ref-goldsteinetal1996_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-goldsteinetal1996-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
Swainson's Hawk has adapted well to grazing and pastureland and seems to be holding its own over much of its breeding range, from northern Mexico to the southern parts of the prairie provinces. However, far western populations, like that of Oregon, and southern California, have drastically declined, often due to habitat loss or incompatible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural" title="Agricultural" class="mw-redirect">agricultural</a> practices. A possible reason for declines in parts of its range may be agriculturally motivated reductions in populations of both ground squirrels and grasshoppers, major seasonal foods.
Although often nesting close to human activity, some Swainson's Hawks are very easily disturbed at the nest and often desert, especially early in the season. The bird is often quite tame and an easy target for shooters traveling isolated prairie roads. The species may also be affected in ways yet to be understood by some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide" title="Insecticide">insecticides</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicide" title="Herbicide">herbicides</a>, including those used on its wintering grounds.<sup id="cite_ref-goldsteinetal1996_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-goldsteinetal1996-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
One of the best places to view the hawk is in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_River_Birds_of_Prey_National_Conservation_Area" title="Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area" class="mw-redirect">Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area</a> (NCA) in Idaho. Birds in the NCA are most frequently sighted in mid March, May, and June, in the early morning and evening when they are actively hunting. In April, Swanson's Hawks engage in more sedentary breeding and egg-guarding, and are thus more difficult to spot. In July, rising canyon temperatures make prey scarce, so many birds of prey migrate away.
Another good site to see Swanson's Hawk is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Prairie_Reserve" title="American Prairie Reserve">American Prairie Reserve</a> in North Eastern Mt.
