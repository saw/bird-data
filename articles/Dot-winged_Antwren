The <b>Dot-winged Antwren</b> (<i>Microrhopias quixensis</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> bird in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antbird" title="Antbird">antbird</a> family. In the past it was sometimes known as the <b>Velvety Antwren</b>, and some of its more distinctive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> have their own infrequently used English names. It is a resident in tropical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> from southeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> south to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>. It is the only member of the genus <i>Microrhopias</i>.
This is a common bird of the understory of wet forest, especially at edges and clearings, tall second growth, and in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacao_plantation" title="Cacao plantation" class="mw-redirect">cacao plantations</a>. The female lays two brown-spotted white eggs which are incubated by both sexes, in a small, deep, plant fibre and dead leaf cup nest 1–12&nbsp;m high in a tree on a thin twig in thick foliage. The male and female parents both feed the chicks.
The Dot-winged Antwren is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_warbler" title="New World warbler">warbler-like</a> bird, typically 11&nbsp;cm long, and weighing 8.5&nbsp;g. The adult male is mainly velvety black, with a broad white wing bar and white spots on the wing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_(feather)" title="Covert (feather)" class="mw-redirect">coverts</a>. The female shares the male’s wing pattern, but has dark <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_gray" title="Slate gray">slate</a> upperparts and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufous" title="Rufous">rufous</a> underparts. There are significant variations in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> depending on the exact subspecies; in the male this mainly involves the amount of white in the wings and tail, and this is reflected in the female. However, in the female the subspecies also differ in the darkness of the upperparts (<i>bicolor</i> of the south-central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Rainforest" title="Amazon Rainforest" class="mw-redirect">Amazon</a> is relatively pale grey above), and the amount of rufous below (<i>quixensis</i> of the northwestern Amazon has a black throat, <i>nigriventris</i> found along the east <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean" title="Andean" class="mw-redirect">Andean</a> slope in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a> has a black belly and chin, and <i>emiliae</i> of the southeastern Amazon has black underparts except for the rufous chest). Young birds are sooty-brown above, shading to dull cinnamon below. The underpart colouration is more extensive and more rufous in young females.
This species has a whistled <i>peep</i> call, and the song is an ascending whistle and trill, <i>chee chee chee-che-che-chr,r,r,r</i>, but with some geographical variations.
The Dot-winged Antwren is found as pairs or family groups, and sometimes with other antwrens as part of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-species_feeding_flock" title="Mixed-species feeding flock" class="mw-redirect">mixed-species feeding flock</a> It feeds on small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a> taken from twigs and foliage in the thickets or vine tangles. It is often seen foraging in more exposed positions than its relatives.
