The <b>Greater Scaup</b> (<i>Aythya marila</i>), just <b>Scaup</b> in Europe, or colloquially "Bluebill" in North America for its bright blue bill,<sup id="cite_ref-Bluebills_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bluebills-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> is a mid-sized diving duck though it is larger than the closely related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Scaup" title="Lesser Scaup">Lesser Scaup</a>. It is a circumpolar species, which means that its range circles one of Earth's poles. It spends the summer months breeding in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, northern Canada, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>, and the northernmost reaches of Europe. During the winter, it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrates</a> south down the coasts of North America, Europe, and Japan.
Drake Greater Scaup are larger and have more rounded heads than females; they have a bright blue bill and yellow eyes. They have dark heads with a glossy green tint, white undersides and wings with white on the tips. The females are mostly brown, with white bands located on their wingtips. They have a blue bill that is slightly duller then the drake's.
Greater Scaup nest near water, typically on islands in northern lakes or on floating mats of vegetation. They begin breeding at age two, but start building nests in the first year. The drakes have a complex <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship" title="Courtship">courtship</a> procedure, which takes place on the return migration to the summer breeding grounds and concludes with the formation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a> pairs. Females lay a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)" title="Clutch (eggs)">clutch</a> of six to nine olive-buff colored eggs. The eggs hatch in 24 to 28 days. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_feather" title="Down feather">down-covered</a> ducklings are able to follow their mother in her search for food immediately after hatching.
Greater Scaup eat aquatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusks" title="Mollusks" class="mw-redirect">mollusks</a>, plants, and insects, which they obtain by diving underwater. They form large groups, called "rafts", that can number in the thousands. Their main threat is human development, although they are preyed upon by owls, skunks, raccoons, foxes, coyotes, and humans. Greater Scaup populations have been declining since the 1980s; however, they are still listed as a species of least concern on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>

Greater Scaup typically nest on islands in large northern lakes. Greater Scaup begin breeding when they are two years old, although they may start nesting at age one. Drake Greater Scaup have a soft quick whistle to get the attention of hens during their courtship which takes place from late winter to early spring, on the way back to their northern breeding grounds. Female Greater Scaup have a single pitch, a raspy “arrr-arrr-arrr-arrr-arrr” sounding vocalization.<sup id="cite_ref-Greater_Scaup_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Greater_Scaup-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> The courtship procedure is complex and results in the formation of monogamous pairs.<sup id="cite_ref-Utahwildlife_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Utahwildlife-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> Pairs nest in close proximity to each other in large colonies, usually near water, on an island or shoreline, or on a raft of floating vegetation.
