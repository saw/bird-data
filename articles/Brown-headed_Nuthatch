It is a frequent visitor to feeding stations and is highly fond of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower" title="Sunflower">sunflower</a> seeds and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suet" title="Suet">suet</a> cakes.

Despite the other species' common name, the brown-headed nuthatch is about the same size as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmy_Nuthatch" title="Pygmy Nuthatch">Pygmy Nuthatch</a> and the two species are the world's smallest nuthatches. In the brown-headed nuthatch, the total length is 9–11 cm (3.5–4.3 in), wingspan is 16–18 cm (6.3–7.1 in) and body mass is 10–12 g (0.35–0.42 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> This species sports a brown cap with narrow black eyeline and buff white cheeks, chin, and belly. Its wings are bluish-gray in color. A small white spot is found at the nape of the neck. The bird's call is a sharp <i>whee-hyah</i> sounding very similar to a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck" title="Rubber duck">rubber duck</a>" toy and particularly is loud for a bird its size. They also make softer <i>"pit pit pit"</i> calls while in flight as well as other squeaking noises. If heard or seen well, this species is virtually unmistakable in the wild, since it overlaps only with the very different marked and larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-breasted_Nuthatch" title="Red-breasted Nuthatch">Red-breasted</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-breasted_Nuthatch" title="White-breasted Nuthatch">White-breasted Nuthatches</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
