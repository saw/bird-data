The <b>Olive Warbler</b> (<i>Peucedramus taeniatus</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a>. It is the only member of the genus <i><b>Peucedramus</b></i> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <b>Peucedramidae</b>.
This species breeds from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>, USA, south through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>. It is the only bird family endemic to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> (including Central America).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It was in the past classed with the Parulidae (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_warbler" title="New World warbler">New World warblers</a>), but DNA studies suggest that it split early from the other related passerines, prior to the differentiation of the entire New World warbler/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_sparrow" title="American sparrow">American sparrow</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icterid" title="Icterid">Icterid</a> group. It is therefore now given a family of its own.
It is an insectivorous species of coniferous forests. Though it is often said to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">non-migratory</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-Sibley_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sibley-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> most New Mexican birds leave the state from November to late February.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> It lays 3–4 eggs in a tree nest.
The Olive Warbler was originally placed in the New World warbler (family Parulidae) genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendroica" title="Dendroica" class="mw-redirect">Dendroica</a></i>, a group which it closely resembles, particularly in having nine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">primaries</a> and similar skin. In spite of being assigned to its own genus in 1875, its affinities were a source of contention.<sup id="cite_ref-Webster_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Webster-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The shape of the basihyal bone in the skull, and aspects of its behaviour led to the suggestion that it was instead an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_warbler" title="Old World warbler">Old World warbler</a> in the family Sylviidae. That it was not in the family Parulidae was supported by the arrangement of muscles in the legs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA-DNA_hybridization" title="DNA-DNA hybridization">DNA-DNA hybridization</a> placed the Olive Warbler as an early branch of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finch" title="Finch">finch</a> clade (which included the finches, cardinals and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_honeycreeper" title="Hawaiian honeycreeper">Hawaiian honeycreepers</a>) and the New World sparrow clade (which includes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanager" title="Tanager">tanagers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icterid" title="Icterid">icterids</a> and New world warblers),<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> and a 1998 study of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA" title="Mitochondrial DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> confirmed its status as being far removed from the New world warblers.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">generic</a> name of the Olive Warbler, <i>Peucedramus</i>, is derived from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Greek</a> <i>peuke</i> for a fir tree and <i>dromos</i> for runner, (from <i>trekho</i>, meaning run), a reference to its feeding habitat and behaviour. The species name, <i>taeniatus</i>, is from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>taenia</i> for a headband, and <i>atus</i> for possessing, a reference to its facial markings.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The original specific name for the species was <i>olivaceus</i>; however that name was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature" title="International Code of Zoological Nomenclature">preoccupied</a> and the name was changed.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Olive Warbler is a medium sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warbler" title="Warbler">warbler</a>, 13–14 cm (5.1–5.5 in) in length and weighing 9.5–12 g (0.34–0.42 oz). It shows clinal variation in size, with more northern populations being larger than southern ones, a phenomenon known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergmann%27s_rule" title="Bergmann's rule">Bergmann's rule</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Webster_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Webster-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The Olive Warbler is a long-winged bird. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> of the male is mostly grey body with some olive-green on the wings and two white wing bars. The male's head and breast are "tawny-orange",<sup id="cite_ref-Sibley_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sibley-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and there is a black patch through the eye. In the female and juvenile, the orange is replaced by yellow, and the black mask is more diffuse. In addition to differences in size, plumage varies geographically as well, with southern birds having more brightly coloured plumage.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_vocalization" title="Bird vocalization">song</a> consists of clear whistles rendered as <i>hirrJI hirrJI hirrJI</i>, <i>plida plida plida chir chir</i>, etc.<sup id="cite_ref-Sibley_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sibley-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The male sings throughout the year, with the frequency of the singing increasing in late winter and reaching a peak in early spring. During the year the male sings the most during the midmorning, but during spring the male sings constantly during mornings and late afternoon. Song is usually delivered from the canopy or other tall trees.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Olive Warbler is a bird of mountains and highlands. In northern areas of its range it occurs from 2,600&nbsp;m above sea level or more, in some parts of its range it may not occur below 3,500&nbsp;m. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca" title="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a> in Mexico it occupies a range of between 1,700–3,000&nbsp;m further south in Guatemala it ranges down to 1,850&nbsp;m and at the southern end of its range it can be found as low as 1,000&nbsp;m in Honduras and in Nicaragua it occupies a belt of forest from 1,070 and 1,370&nbsp;m.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_10-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> They typically inhabit conifer forests, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_ponderosa" title="Pinus ponderosa">ponderosa</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_lambertiana" title="Pinus lambertiana">sugar</a> pine forests in Arizona, <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abies" title="Abies" class="mw-redirect">Abies</a></i> common fir forests, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak" title="Oak">oak</a>, and pine forests in central Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras.

Over most of its range the species is resident, but there is evidence that the most northerly populations are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">partial migrants</a>. Birds in Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico apparently move away from their breeding grounds, although what exact movements are made is unclear. It has been suggested that they are either "down slope migrants", moving to lower elevations, or dispersive, as some records show their presence in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>. Birds attributed to the northern race <i>P. t. arizonae</i> have been recorded near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepic" title="Tepic">Tepic</a>, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayarit" title="Nayarit">Nayarit</a>.
