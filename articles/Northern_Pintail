<i>Dafila acuta</i>
The <b>Pintail</b> or <b>Northern Pintail</b> (<i>Anas acuta</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck" title="Duck">duck</a> with wide geographic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)" title="Range (biology)">distribution</a> that breeds in the northern areas of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> and winters south of its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeding_range" title="Breeding range" class="mw-redirect">breeding range</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator" title="Equator">equator</a>. Unusually for a bird with such a large range, it has no geographical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> if the possibly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific" title="Conspecific" class="mw-redirect">conspecific</a> duck <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaton%27s_Pintail" title="Eaton's Pintail">Eaton's Pintail</a> is considered to be a separate species.
This is a large duck, and the male's long central tail feathers give rise to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running from the back of its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dabbling_duck" title="Dabbling duck" class="mw-redirect">dabbling ducks</a>. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.
The Northern Pintail is a bird of open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland" title="Wetland">wetlands</a> which nests on the ground, often some distance from water. It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> to its diet during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesting_season" title="Nesting season">nesting season</a>. It is highly gregarious when not breeding, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck. This duck's population is affected by predators, parasites and avian diseases. Human activities, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing, have also had a significant impact on numbers. Nevertheless, this species' huge range and large population mean that it is not threatened globally.
This species was first described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus" title="Carl Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his <i>Systema naturae</i> in 1758 as <i>Anas acuta</i><sup id="cite_ref-Linnaeus_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Linnaeus-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The scientific name comes from two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> words: <i>anas</i>, meaning "duck", and <i>acuta</i>, which comes from the verb <i>acuere</i>, which means "sharpen"; the species term, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> name, refers to the pointed tail of the male in breeding plumage.<sup id="cite_ref-ukrec_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ukrec-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Within the large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatinae" title="Anatinae">dabbling duck</a> genus <i>Anas</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-Linnaeus_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Linnaeus-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> the Northern Pintail's closest relatives are other pintails, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-billed_Pintail" title="Yellow-billed Pintail">Yellow-billed Pintail</a> (<i>A. georgica</i>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaton%27s_Pintail" title="Eaton's Pintail">Eaton's Pintail</a> (<i>A. eatoni</i>).

The Northern Pintail is a fairly large duck with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> of 23.6–28.2&nbsp;cm (9.3–11.1&nbsp;in) and wingspan of 80–95 cm (31–37 in).<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The male is 59–76&nbsp;cm (23–30&nbsp;in) in length and weighs 450–1360&nbsp;grammes (1–3&nbsp;lb), and therefore is considerably larger than the female, which is 51–64&nbsp;cm (20–25&nbsp;in) long and weighs 454–1135&nbsp;grammes (1–2.5&nbsp;lb).<sup id="cite_ref-umich_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> The Northern Pintail broadly overlaps in size with the similarly-widespread <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallard" title="Mallard">Mallard</a>, but is more slender, elongated and gracile, with a relatively longer neck and (in males) a longer tail. The unmistakable breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumaged</a> male has a chocolate-brown head and white breast with a white stripe extending up the side of the neck. Its upperparts and sides are grey, but elongated grey feathers with black central stripes are draped across the back from the shoulder area. The vent area is yellow, contrasting with the black underside of the tail,<sup id="cite_ref-Madge_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> which has the central feathers elongated to as much as 10&nbsp;centimetres (4&nbsp;in). The bill is bluish and the legs are blue-grey.<sup id="cite_ref-Gooders_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gooders-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
The adult female is mainly scalloped and mottled in light brown with a more uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill.<sup id="cite_ref-Madge_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake Pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculum_feathers" title="Speculum feathers">speculum</a> with a narrower trailing edge.<sup id="cite_ref-Collins_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Collins-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Pintail walks well on land, and swims well.<sup id="cite_ref-Madge_8-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> It has a very fast flight, with its wings slightly swept-back, rather than straight out from the body like other ducks. In flight, the male shows a black speculum bordered white at the rear and pale rufous at the front, whereas the female's speculum is dark brown bordered with white, narrowly at the front edge but very prominently at the rear, being visible at a distance of 1600&nbsp;metres (1&nbsp;mi).<sup id="cite_ref-Collins_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Collins-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
The male's call is a soft <i>proop-proop</i> whistle, similar to that of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Teal" title="Common Teal" class="mw-redirect">Common Teal</a>, whereas the female has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallard" title="Mallard">Mallard-like</a> descending quack, and a low croak when flushed.<sup id="cite_ref-Madge_8-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Northern Pintail's breeding habitat is open unwooded wetlands, such as wet grassland, lakesides or tundra. In winter, it will utilise a wider range of open habitats, such as sheltered estuaries, brackish marshes and coastal lagoons. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms very large mixed flocks with other ducks.<sup id="cite_ref-Madge_8-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
Both sexes reach sexual maturity at one year of age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there is a group of males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers on the back of her head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.<sup id="cite_ref-umich_11-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
Breeding takes place between April and June, with the nest being constructed on the ground and hidden amongst vegetation in a dry location, often some distance from water. It is a shallow scrape on the ground lined with plant material and down.<sup id="cite_ref-Madge_8-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The female lays seven to nine cream-coloured eggs at the rate of one per day;<sup id="cite_ref-umich_11-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> the eggs are 55&nbsp;x&nbsp;38 millimetres (2.2&nbsp;x&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;in) in size and weigh 45&nbsp;grammes (1.6&nbsp;oz), of which 7% is shell.<sup id="cite_ref-BTO_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BTO-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> If predators destroy the first clutch, the female can produce a replacement clutch as late as the end of July.<sup id="cite_ref-umich_11-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
The hen alone incubates the eggs for 22 to 24 days before they hatch. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial" title="Precocial">precocial</a> downy chicks are then led by the female to the nearest body of water, where they feed on dead insects on the water surface. The chicks fledge in 46 to 47 days after hatching, but stay with the female until she has completed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moult" title="Moult" class="mw-redirect">moulting</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-umich_11-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Pintail feeds by dabbling and upending in shallow water for plant food mainly in the evening or at night, and therefore spends much of the day resting.<sup id="cite_ref-Madge_8-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Its long neck enables it to take food items from the bottom of water bodies up to 30&nbsp;centimetres (1&nbsp;ft) deep, which are beyond the reach of other dabbling ducks like the Mallard.<sup id="cite_ref-Gooders_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gooders-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
The winter diet is mainly plant material including seeds and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome" title="Rhizome">rhizomes</a> of aquatic plants, but the Pintail sometimes feeds on roots, grain and other seeds in fields, though less frequently than other <i>Anas</i> ducks.<sup id="cite_ref-Gooders_12-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gooders-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> During the nesting season, this bird eats mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrate</a> animals, including aquatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusca" title="Mollusca">molluscs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-umich_11-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Northern Pintail is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEWA" title="AEWA" class="mw-redirect">AEWA</a>) applies,<sup id="cite_ref-AEWA_36-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AEWA-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> but it has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES" title="CITES">CITES</a>), which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants.<sup id="cite_ref-umich_11-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
