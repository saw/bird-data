The <b>Oriental Pratincole</b> (<i>Glareola maldivarum</i>), also known as the Grasshopper-Bird or Swallow-Plover is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">wader</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratincole" title="Pratincole">pratincole</a> family, Glareolidae.
Their most unusual feature of the pratincoles is that although classed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">waders</a> they typically hunt their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insect</a> prey on the wing like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirundinidae" title="Hirundinidae" class="mw-redirect">swallows</a>, although they can also feed on the ground.
These are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a> of open country, and are often seen near water in the evening, hawking for insects. These pratincoles are found in warmer parts of south and east <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, breeding from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Pakistan" title="Northern Pakistan" class="mw-redirect">Northern Pakistan</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_region" title="Kashmir region" class="mw-redirect">Kashmir region</a> across into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> and south west. Their 2-3 eggs are laid on the ground. They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering in both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia" title="Australasia">Australasia</a>. They are rare north or west of the breeding range, but, amazingly, this species has occurred as far away as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> more than once. The first record for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Palearctic" title="Western Palearctic" class="mw-redirect">Western Palearctic</a> was in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk" title="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> in June 1981.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
These <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a> have short legs, long pointed wings and long forked tails. They have short bills, which is an adaptation to aerial feeding. The back and head are brown, and the wings are brown with black flight feathers. The belly is white. The underwings are chestnut.
Very good views are needed to distinguish this species from other pratincoles, such as the very similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collared_Pratincole" title="Collared Pratincole">Collared Pratincole</a>, which also has a chestnut underwing, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-winged_Pratincole" title="Black-winged Pratincole">Black-winged Pratincole</a> which shares the black upperwing flight feathers and lack of a white trailing edge to the wing. These features are not always readily seen in the field, especially as the chestnut underwing appears black unless excellent views are obtained.
On the 7th of February 2004, 2.5 million Oriental Pratincoles were recorded on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighty_Mile_Beach" title="Eighty Mile Beach">Eighty Mile Beach</a> in Australia's north-west by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_Wader_Studies_Group" title="Australasian Wader Studies Group">Australasian Wader Studies Group</a>. There had previously been no record of this magnitude and it is supposed that weather conditions caused much of the world's population of this species to congregate in one area.
