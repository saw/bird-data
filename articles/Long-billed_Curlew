<i>Numenius longirostra(is)</i>
The <b>Long-billed Curlew</b> (<i>Numenius americanus</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorebird" title="Shorebird" class="mw-redirect">shorebird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scolopacidae" title="Scolopacidae" class="mw-redirect">Scolopacidae</a>. This species was also called "<b>sicklebird</b>"<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> and the <b>"candlestick bird"</b>. The species is native to central and western North America. In the winter, the species migrates southwards, as well as towards the coastline.
The Long-billed Curlew is the largest nesting or regularly-occurring sandpiper in North America. It is 50–65 cm (20–26 in) long, 62–90 cm (24–35 in) across the wing and weighs 490–950 g (1.1–2.1 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Its extremely long bill measures 11.3–21.9 cm (4.4–8.6 in), and rivals the bill of the larger-bodied <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Eastern_Curlew" title="Far Eastern Curlew" class="mw-redirect">Far Eastern Curlew</a> as the longest bill of any shorebird.<sup id="cite_ref-Marchant_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Marchant-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Adults have a very long bill curved downwards, a long neck and a small head. The neck and underparts are a light cinnamon, while the crown is streaked with brown. This species exhibits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, the female having a much longer bill than the male.
Their breeding habitat is grasslands in west-central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. The species displays an elaborate courtship dance during breeding season. Fast and looping display flights are also common. A small hollow is lined with various weeds and grasses to serve as the nest. Four eggs are always laid as this is a characteristic of shorebirds. The eggs vary in hue from white to olive. The Long-billed Curlew is a precocial bird, and the chicks leave the nest soon after hatching. Both parents look after the young.
The bird usually feeds in flocks. Using its long bill, it probes the mud near its habitat, foraging for suitable food. The usual food consists of crabs and various other small invertebrates. The species also feeds on grasshoppers, beetles and other insects. This bird has occasionally been known to eat the eggs of other birds.
The population was significantly reduced at the end of the 19th century by hunting. Numbers have rebounded somewhat in more recent times. It was formerly classified as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Threatened" title="Near Threatened">Near Threatened</a> species by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> but new research has confirmed that the Long-billed Curlew is again common and widespread (Jones et al. 2008). Consequently, it is downlisted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern" title="Least Concern">Least Concern</a> status in 2008.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
