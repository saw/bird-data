Measuring 38–43 centimetres (15–17 in) in length, it is a stocky short-tailed green parrot with a yellow head. It prefers to live in mangrove forests or forests near rivers or other bodies of water.

This species is part of the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazona_ochrocephala" title="Amazona ochrocephala" class="mw-redirect">Amazona ochrocephala</a></i> complex, which also includes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-naped_Amazon" title="Yellow-naped Amazon">Yellow-naped Amazon</a> (<i>A. auropalliata</i>).

The split is mainly based on the amount of yellow in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a>, the color of the legs and bill, the proximity of <i>A. oratrix</i> and <i>A. auropalliata</i> in Oaxaca, Mexico, without apparent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">interbreeding</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and the presence of both <i>A. ochrocephala</i> and <i>A. auropalliata</i> in northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras" title="Honduras">Honduras</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> This evaluation has, however, been confused by misunderstandings regarding the plumage variations in the populations in northern Honduras, where birds vary greatly in amount of yellow on the head, crown and nape, but have pale bills and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_(organism)" title="Juvenile (organism)">juvenile</a> plumage matching <i>A. oratrix</i>, but neither <i>A. ochrocephala</i> nor <i>A. auropalliata</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-H.26W_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H.26W-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-LousadaHowell_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LousadaHowell-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1997, the population from the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Sula_Valley&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sula Valley (page does not exist)">Sula Valley</a> in northern Honduras was described as a new subspecies, <i>hondurensis</i>, of <i>A. oratrix</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>A. auropalliata caribaea</i> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islas_de_la_Bah%C3%ADa" title="Islas de la Bahía" class="mw-redirect">Islas de la Bahía</a>, which is relatively close to the recently described <i>A. oratrix hondurensis</i>, may have a relatively pale lower mandible, indicating that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_flow" title="Gene flow">gene flow</a> may occur between the two.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> If confirmed, this could suggest that the two are better considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific" title="Conspecific" class="mw-redirect">conspecific</a>.

The origin of the common epithet "<i>Double</i> Yellow-headed" is that this species is differentiated from the others in the Yellow-headed Amazon complex by possessing both the yellow nape and yellow crown of its two close relatives, hence a "double-yellow" head.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from September 2008">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The body is bright green, with yellow on the head, dark scallops on the neck, red at the bend of the wing, and yellow thighs. The flight <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">feathers</a> are blackish to bluish violet with a red patch on the outer secondaries. The base of the tail also has a red patch, which is usually hidden. The outer tail feathers have yellowish tips.<sup id="cite_ref-H.26W_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H.26W-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The bill is horn-colored, darker in immatures of the Belizean subspecies. The eye ring is whitish in Mexican birds and grayish in others. The most conspicuous geographical difference is the amount of yellow. In adults, the head and upper chest are yellow in the subspecies of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islas_Tres_Mar%C3%ADas" title="Islas Tres Marías" class="mw-redirect">Tres Marías Islands</a> (<i>tresmariae</i>); just the head in the widespread subspecies of Mexico (<i>oratrix</i>); just the crown in Belize (<i>belizensis</i>); and the crown and nape in the Sula Valley of Honduras (<i>hondurensis</i>, which thus resembles the Yellow-naped Parrot). Immatures have less yellow than adults; they attain adult plumage in 2 to 4 years.<sup id="cite_ref-H.26W_2-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H.26W-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed" title="Breed">variety</a> "Magna" (or "Magnum") is bred for more yellow and commands a premium price as a pet.<sup id="cite_ref-Aves_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Aves-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Some "extreme" Magnas have as much yellow as Tres Marías birds, but are distinguished from them by heavier barring on the chest and a less bluish tint to the green plumage.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
Wild birds give low-pitched, sometimes human-sounding screams, but often fly silently (unlike many other parrots). The calls can be described as "a rolled <i>kyaa-aa-aaah</i> and <i>krra-aah-aa-ow</i>, a deep, rolled <i>ahrrrr</i> or <i>ahrhrrrr</i>," etc.<sup id="cite_ref-H.26W_2-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H.26W-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Young birds make a "clucking" sound to indicate that they are hungry.

Captive-bred Yellow-headed Amazons can be sold and owned legally subject to checks and regulations. Populations range from Central America, through Mexico, and even into the Southmost region of Texas. Generally, throughout the world, sale of Appendix I species bred in aviculture must be accompanied with official certification which is provided by the breeder, and they must have a closed ring on one leg.
The popularity of Yellow-headed Amazons as a pet continues to fuel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching" title="Poaching">poaching</a> efforts, which have nearly driven it to extinction in the wild.

Yellow-headed Parrots nest in holes in tree trunks or fallen branches. Poachers usually hack at the nest site with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machete" title="Machete">machete</a> to steal parrots, which is especially destructive because habitat is lost at the same time that the wild parrot population is reduced.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The situation for <i>tresmariae</i>, which potentially can be treated as a separate species, is unclear, but its very small range gives cause for concern and some reports indicate it is under considerable threat.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>

As in most amazons, nervous plucking of plumage is rare among this species. A generally recognized disadvantage of the Yellow-headed Amazon and its close relatives (such as the Yellow-naped Amazon) is hormonal aggressiveness, most notable among males in the breeding season. It is a member of the "Hot Three" (referring to the male bird's 'hot' temper), along with the Yellow-naped and Blue-fronted.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup>
