The <b>Curve-billed Thrasher</b> (<i>Toxostoma curvirostre</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perching_bird" title="Perching bird" class="mw-redirect">perching</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrasher" title="Thrasher">thrasher</a> group native to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">southwestern</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and much of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.
The Curve-billed Thrasher is generally 25 to 28&nbsp;cm (10 to 12&nbsp;inches) long, slender in build with a long tail, and a long, curved, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle" title="Sickle">sickle</a>-shaped bill. It is pale grayish-brown above with lighter-colored underparts that are vaguely streaked. The tips of the tail are streaked with white, and the sides of the tail are a darker color than its back. The eye of an adult is usually a vivid orange or red-orange, although immature birds have a yellow eye.
Because of its similar coloration to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendire%27s_Thrasher" title="Bendire's Thrasher">Bendire's Thrasher</a>, the two birds are easily mistaken for one another. Bendire's Thrasher's shorter and straighter bill and yellow eyes distinguish it from mature Curve-billed Thrashers. However, it is still easy to misidentify a young Curve-billed Thrasher as a Bendire's Thrasher as its beak has not grown to its mature length and curvature, and its eyes are still yellow. Aside from Bendire's Thrasher, the Curve-billed Thrasher can be easily distinguished from other thrasher species in its range as it has a streaked breast, unlike the others' plain breasts.
The Curve-billed Thrasher is commonly found throughout the deserts and brush-filled areas of the south-western United States, from about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoran_Desert" title="Sonoran Desert">Sonoran Desert</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> and across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a> to west <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, as well as most of Mexico, from the Sonoran-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahuan_Desert" title="Chihuahuan Desert">Chihuahuan Deserts</a> and south through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Plateau" title="Mexican Plateau">Mexican Plateau</a> to regions south of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordillera_Neovolcanica" title="Cordillera Neovolcanica" class="mw-redirect">Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt</a> in south-central Mexico.
The Curve-billed Thrasher often roosts in a tall tree or spiny vegetation, preferring a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus" title="Cactus">cactus</a>. The nest is a loosely woven cup made of thorny twigs. The female lays 2 to 4 eggs, which are bluish-green and speckled with brown. The eggs are incubated by both sexes, and hatch after about thirteen days. The young will leave the nest after 14 to 18 days after hatching.
The Curve-billed Thrasher feeds on ground-dwelling insects, as well as seeds, and berries. It often pushes out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus_Wren" title="Cactus Wren">Cactus Wrens</a> in its area. This thrasher's voice is a sharp, liquid, whistle <i>wit-WEET!</i>, or <i>wit-WEET-wit</i>, as well as a warbling, squeaky, hurried song.
