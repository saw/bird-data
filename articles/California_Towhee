The <b>California Towhee</b> (<i>Melozone crissalis</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> of the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emberizidae" title="Emberizidae">Emberizidae</a>, native to the coastal regions of western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon" title="Oregon">Oregon</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California_Sur" title="Baja California Sur">Baja California Sur</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.
The taxonomy of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> has been debated. At the higher level, some authors place the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towhee" title="Towhee">towhees</a> in the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringillidae" title="Fringillidae" class="mw-redirect">Fringillidae</a>. Within the group, there has been debate about whether the distinction between this species and the similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon_Towhee" title="Canyon Towhee">Canyon Towhee</a>, <i>Melozone fuscus</i>, should be at the specific or subspecific level. The two populations are quite isolated from each other, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_genetics" title="Molecular genetics">molecular genetics</a> seems to have settled the matter in favour of two distinct species for the present. On the other hand there seems to be little distinction between the northern and Baja Californian populations within <i>M. crissalis</i>.
The California Towhee's coloring is dull brown overall with light rust undertail coverts and buff or rust colored streaks at the throat. There is little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>. It is around 20–25 cm (7.9–9.8 in) in length, and has a noticeably long tail of 8.2 to 11.6 cm (3.2 to 4.6 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Byers_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Byers-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Its appearance suggests a large, plain sparrow.

This bird's natural habitat is brush or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaparral" title="Chaparral">chaparral</a>, but it adapts well to urban parks and gardens. However, its skulking habits combined with its nondescript appearance mean that it is not one of the better known garden birds even though it is regularly drawn to feeding stations.
Nests are typically found in low branches or shrubs about .5 to nearly 4 meters (2 to 12 feet) above ground. The nest is a bulky cup made of twigs, stems, grasses, and hair.
The California Towhee feeds on the ground or in low scrub where it prefers a variety of seeds and some insects. It is most often seen traveling or feeding singly or in pairs with mixed flocks. they usually hop on the ground like many small birds, but will run if disturbed. they will occasionally hide under parked cars when in danger.
The call is a metallic sounding <i>chink</i> and the song consists of a long repeating series ended with a trill.
The female incubates the nest of 2 to 4 eggs alone for 11 days. Eggs are laid from March through September with shells that are slightly glossy and pale bluish white with some brownish flecks concentrated mostly on the larger end. Young leave the nest after 8 days.
