<i>Helodromas solitarius</i>
The <b>Solitary Sandpiper</b> (<i>Tringa solitaria</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">wader</a> (shorebird).
This species measures 18–23 cm (7.1–9.1 in) long, with a wingspan up to 50&nbsp;cm (20&nbsp;in) and a body mass of 31–65 g (1.1–2.3 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CRC_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> It is a dumpy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">wader</a> with a dark green back, greyish head and breast and otherwise white underparts. It is obvious in flight, with wings dark above and below, and a dark rump and tail centre. The latter feature distinguishes it from the slightly larger and broader-winged, but otherwise very similar, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Sandpiper" title="Green Sandpiper">Green Sandpiper</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, to which it is closely related.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The latter species has a brilliant white rump. In flight, the Solitary Sandpiper has a characteristic three-note whistle. They both have brown wings with little light dots, and a delicate but contrasting neck and chest pattern. In addition, both species nest in trees, unlike most other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scolopacidae" title="Scolopacidae" class="mw-redirect">scolopacids</a>.
It breeds in woodlands across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>. It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a>, wintering in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, especially in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River" title="Amazon River">Amazon River</a> basin, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. It is a very rare vagrant to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>.
The Solitary Sandpiper is not a gregarious species, usually seen alone during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migration</a>, although sometimes small numbers congregate in suitable feeding areas. The Solitary Sandpiper is very much a bird of fresh water, and is often found in sites, such as ditches, too restricted for other waders, which tend to like a clear all-round view.
The sandpiper lays a clutch of 3–5 eggs in abandoned tree nests of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbird</a> species, such as those of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_(bird)" title="Thrush (bird)">thrushes</a>. The young birds are encouraged to drop to the ground soon after hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Food is small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a>, sometimes small frogs, picked off the mud as the bird works steadily around the edges of its chosen pond.
