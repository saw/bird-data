<i>Vireo olivaceus flavoviridis</i>
The <b>Yellow-green Vireo</b> (<i>Vireo flavoviridis</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a>. It breeds from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> (occasionally the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_Valley" title="Rio Grande Valley">Rio Grande Valley</a>) in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and the western and eastern mountain ranges of northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_Occidental" title="Sierra Madre Occidental">Sierra Madre Occidental</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_Oriental" title="Sierra Madre Oriental">Sierra Madre Oriental</a>—also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordillera_Neovolcanica" title="Cordillera Neovolcanica" class="mw-redirect">Cordillera Neovolcanica</a>) south to central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a>. It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering in the northern and eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a> and the western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_basin" title="Amazon basin" class="mw-redirect">Amazon basin</a>.
The adult Yellow-green Vireo is 14–14.7&nbsp;cm in length and weighs 18.5 g. It has olive-green upperparts and a dusky-edged gray crown. There is a dark line from the bill to the red-brown eyes, and a white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercilium" title="Supercilium">supercilium</a>. The underparts are white with yellow breast sides and flanks. Young birds are duller with brown eyes, a brown tint to the back, and less yellow on the underparts. The adult Yellow-green Vireo differs from the Red-eyed Vireo in its much yellower underparts, lack of a black border to the duller gray crown, yellower upperparts and different eye color.
Some individuals are difficult to separate, even in the hand, from the similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-eyed_Vireo" title="Red-eyed Vireo">Red-eyed Vireo</a>, with which it is sometimes considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific" title="Conspecific" class="mw-redirect">conspecific</a>. Its exact status as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passage_migrant" title="Passage migrant" class="mw-redirect">passage bird</a> in countries such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> is therefore uncertain.
The Yellow-green Vireo has a nasal <i>nyaaah</i> call, and the song is a repetitive <i>veree veer viree, fee’er vireo viree</i>, shorter and faster than that of the Red-eyed Vireo. This species rarely sings on its wintering grounds.
This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vireo" title="Vireo">vireo</a> occurs in the canopy and middle levels of light woodland, the edges of forest, and gardens at altitudes from sea level to 1500 m. The 6.5-cm-wide cup nest is built by the female from a wide range of plant materials, and attached to a stout twig normally 1.5–3.5 m above the ground in a tree, but occasionally up to 12 m high. The normal clutch is two or three brown-marked white eggs laid from March to June and incubated by the female alone, although the male helps to feed the chicks. The breeding birds return to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> from early February to March, and most depart southwards by mid-October
