The <b>Red-headed Woodpecker</b> (<i>Melanerpes erythrocephalus</i>) is a small or medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> from temperate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>.

The Red-headed Woodpecker was one of the many species originally described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolus_Linnaeus" title="Carolus Linnaeus" class="mw-redirect">Linnaeus</a> in his 18th-century work <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae" title="Systema Naturae">Systema Naturae</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The specific epithet is derived from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words <i>erythros</i> 'red' and <i>kephalos</i> 'head'.<sup id="cite_ref-Liddell1980_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Liddell1980-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
There are three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> recognized:
Adults are strikingly tri-colored, with a black back and tail and a red head and neck. Their underparts are mainly white. The wings are black with white secondary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remiges" title="Remiges" class="mw-redirect">remiges</a>. Adult males and females are identical in plumage.<sup id="cite_ref-BirdsOfCarolinas_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdsOfCarolinas-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Juveniles are similarly shaded, but are mottled with brown.<sup id="cite_ref-BirdsOfCarolinas_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdsOfCarolinas-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdwatching" title="Birdwatching">birders</a> may often mistakenly identify <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-bellied_Woodpecker" title="Red-bellied Woodpecker">Red-bellied Woodpeckers</a> as Red-headeds, whose range overlaps somewhat with that of the Red-headed woodpecker. While red-bellied woodpeckers have some bright red on the backs of their necks and heads, red-headed woodpeckers have a much deeper red that covers their entire heads and necks, as well as a dramatically different overall <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> pattern.
These are mid-sized woodpeckers. Both sexes measure from 19 to 25 cm (7.5 to 9.8 in) in length, with a wingspan of 42.5&nbsp;cm (16.7&nbsp;in).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> They can weigh from 56 to 97 g (2.0 to 3.4 oz). Each wing measures 12.7–15 cm (5.0–5.9 in), the tail measures 6.6–8.5 cm (2.6–3.3 in), the bill measures 2.1–3 cm (0.83–1.2 in) and the tarsus measures 1.9–2.5 cm (0.75–0.98 in).<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Red-headed Woodpecker is a once common but declining bird species found in southern Canada and east-central United States. Consistent long-term population declines have resulted in Red-headed Woodpecker’s threatened status in Canada and several states in the US. This has led to an immediate need for conservation, which, as of yet, has been the focus of limited studies. Throughout most of its range it inhabits areas that have been heavily altered by humans. Factors suggested for Red-headed Woodpecker declines include: loss of overall habitat and, within habitats, standing dead wood required for nest sites,<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> limitations of food supply,<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> and possible nest-site competition with other cavity nesters such as European Starlings or Red-bellied Woodpeckers.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Unfortunately few of these factors have been substantiated.
