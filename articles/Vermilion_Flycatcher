The <b>Vermilion Flycatcher</b> (<i>Pyrocephalus rubinus</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> bird in the Tyrannidae, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher" title="Tyrant flycatcher">tyrant flycatcher</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a>. Most flycatchers are rather drab, but the Vermilion Flycatcher is a striking exception. It is a favourite with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdwatching" title="Birdwatching">birders</a>, but is not generally kept in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviculture" title="Aviculture">aviculture</a>, as the males tend to lose their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermilion" title="Vermilion">vermilion</a> colouration when in captivity.
Vermilion Flycatchers generally prefer somewhat open areas, and are found in trees or shrubs in savannah, scrub, agricultural areas, riparian woodlands, and desert as well, but usually near water. Their range includes almost all of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>; it extends north into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">southwestern</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, and south to scattered portions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, parts of northwestern and central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, and on southwards to central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>. They are also found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galapagos_Islands" title="Galapagos Islands" class="mw-redirect">Galapagos Islands</a>. The form inhabiting the Galapagos (<i>P. r. nanus</i>) is sometimes split as <i>Pyrocephalus nanus</i>, <b>Darwin's Flycatcher</b> or the <b>Galapagos Flycatcher</b>.
The species grows to about seven inches in length, and is strongly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">dimorphic</a>; males are bright red, with dark brown plumage. Females have a peach-coloured belly with a dark grey upperside, and are similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Say%27s_Phoebe" title="Say's Phoebe">Say's Phoebe</a>.
The flycatchers feed mostly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flies" title="Flies" class="mw-redirect">flies</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper" title="Grasshopper">grasshoppers</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetles" title="Beetles" class="mw-redirect">beetles</a>. These are usually taken in mid-air, after a short sally flight from a perch.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
They lay 2-3 whitish eggs in a nest made of twigs, stems and roots, and lined with hair. The eggs are incubated for around two weeks by the female and the young are ready to leave the nest 15 days after hatching.
