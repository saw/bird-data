The <b>Greater Prairie Chicken</b> or <b>Pinnated Grouse</b>, <i>Tympanuchus cupido</i>, is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grouse" title="Grouse">grouse</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a>. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> was once abundant, but has become extremely rare or extinct over much of its range due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_loss" title="Habitat loss" class="mw-redirect">habitat loss</a>. There are current efforts to help this species gain the numbers that it once had. One of the most famous aspects of these creatures is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating" title="Mating">mating ritual</a> called booming.
Adults of both sexes are medium sized, stocky, with round-wings. They have short tails which are typically rounded and dark in color. Adult males have orange comb-like feathers over their eyes and dark, elongated head feathers that can be raised or lain along neck. They also possess a circular, un-feathered neck patch can be inflated while displaying, this like their comb feathers is also orange. As with many other bird species the adult females have shorter head feathers and also lack the male's yellow comb and orange neck patch.
There are three subspecies;
Greater Prairie Chickens prefer undisturbed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie" title="Prairie">prairie</a> and were originally found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallgrass_prairie" title="Tallgrass prairie">tall grass prairies</a>. They can tolerate agricultural land mixed with prairie, but the more agricultural land, the fewer prairie-chickens. Their diet consists primarily of seeds and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a>, but during the summer they also eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and green plants. These birds were once widespread all across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_savanna" title="Oak savanna">oak savanna</a> and tall grass prairie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. The Greater Prairie Chicken was almost extinct in the 1930s due to hunting pressure and habitat loss. They now only live on small parcels of managed prairie land. It is thought that their current population is approximately 459,000 individuals.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from July 2010">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In May 2000, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Greater Prairie Chicken as extirpated in its Canadian range (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta" title="Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It was again confirmed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada in November 2009.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
In states such as Missouri that once had thriving prairie chicken populations (estimated to be "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2011-04-21/news/prairie-chicken-recovery-project-missouri-department-of-conservation">hundreds of thousands</a>"), total numbers have dropped to about 500. However, the Missouri Department of Conservation has started a program to import prairie chickens rustled up in Kansas in the hopes that they will be able to repopulate the state and increase that number to 3,000.
Greater Prairie Chickens are not threatened by severe winter weather. When the snow is thick they "dive" in to the snow to keep warm. A greater threat to the prairie chickens comes in the form of spring rains. These sometimes drenching rains can wreak havoc on their chicks. Another major natural threat is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought" title="Drought">drought</a>. A drought can destroy food and make it difficult for the chicks.
Human interactions are by far the greatest threat. The conversion of native prairie to cropland is very detrimental to these birds. It was found in a radio telemetry study conducted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_State_University" title="Kansas State University">Kansas State University</a> that "most prairie chicken hens avoided nesting or rearing their broods within a quarter-mile of power lines and within a third-mile of improved roads." (Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks) It was also found that the prairie-chickens avoided communication towers and rural farms.
Greater Prairie Chickens do not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a>. They are territorial birds and often defend their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lek_(animal_behaviour)" title="Lek (animal behaviour)" class="mw-redirect">booming grounds</a>. These booming grounds are the area in which they perform their displays in hopes of attracting females. Their displays consist of inflating air sacs located on the side of their neck and snapping their tails. These booming grounds usually have very short or no vegetation. The male prairie-chickens stay on this ground displaying for almost two months. The breeding season usually begins in the United States starting in Late March throughout April. During this time the males establish booming sites where they display for the females. The one or two most dominant males will do about 90% of the mating.
After mating has taken place, the females will move about one mile from the booming grounds and begin to build their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nests</a>. Hens lay between 5 and 17 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> per clutch and the eggs take between 23 and 24 days to hatch. There are between five and 10 young per brood. (INRIN, 2005). The young are raised by the female and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> in one to four weeks, are completely independent by the tenth to twelfth week, and reach sexual maturity by age one (Ammann, 1957). One problem facing prairie chickens is competition with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-necked_Pheasant" title="Ring-necked Pheasant" class="mw-redirect">Ring-necked Pheasants</a>. Pheasants will lay their eggs in prairie-chicken nests. The pheasant eggs hatch first; this causes the prairie chickens to leave the nest thinking that the young have hatched. In reality the eggs did not hatch and the young usually die because the mother is not there to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubate</a> the eggs.
