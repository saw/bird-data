The <b>Eurasian Wryneck</b> (<i>Jynx torquilla</i>) is a species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wryneck" title="Wryneck">wryneck</a> in the family of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpeckers</a>.
This species breeds in temperate regions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering in tropical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> and southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. It is a bird of open woodland and orchards. On migration it is frequently seen in sandy areas, where it forages for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ants</a>.
This species measure 16–18 cm (6.3–7.1 in) in length and weighs 26–50 g (0.92–1.8 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Their bills are shorter and less dagger-like than in the other woodpeckers, but their chief prey is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ants</a> and other insects, which they find in decaying wood or almost bare soil. They re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.
These <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a> get their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> name from their ability to turn their heads almost 180 degrees. When disturbed at the nest, they use this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake" title="Snake">snake</a>-like head twisting and hissing as a threat display. This odd behaviour led to their use in witchcraft, hence to put a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinx" title="Jinx">jinx</a>" on someone.
They nest in existing holes.They lay 7 to 10 eggs on May-June
