<b>Anna's Hummingbird</b> (<i>Calypte anna</i>) is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird" title="Hummingbird">hummingbird</a> native to the west coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. This bird was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Mass%C3%A9na,_Duchess_of_Rivoli" title="Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli">Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Anna's Hummingbird is 3.9 to 4.3&nbsp;inches (10 to 11 centimeters)long. It has a bronze-green back, a pale grey chest and belly, and green flanks. Its bill is long, straight and slender. The adult male has an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence" title="Iridescence">iridescent</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimson" title="Crimson">crimson-red</a> crown and throat, and a dark, slightly forked tail. Anna's is the only North American hummingbird species with a red <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(anatomy)" title="Crown (anatomy)">crown</a>. Females and juveniles have a green crown, a grey throat with some red markings, a grey chest and belly, and a dark, rounded tail with white tips on the outer feathers.
These birds feed on nectar from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower" title="Flower">flowers</a> using a long extendable tongue. They also consume small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> caught in flight. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service" title="Public Broadcasting Service" class="mw-redirect">PBS</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary" title="Documentary" class="mw-redirect">documentary</a> that first aired January 10, 2010, shows how Anna's Hummingbirds eat flying insects (at 16:45).<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/hummingbirds-magic-in-the-air/video-full-episode/5475/">[1]</a> They aim for the flying insect, then open their beaks very wide. That technique has a greater success rate than trying to aim the end of a long beak at the insect.
While collecting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectar" title="Nectar">nectar</a>, they also assist in plant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollination" title="Pollination">pollination</a>.

Open-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooded" title="Wooded" class="mw-redirect">wooded</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub" title="Shrub">shrubby</a> areas and mountain meadows along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a> coast from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> make up <i>C. anna'</i>s breeding habitat. The female raises the young without the assistance of the male. The female bird builds a large nest in a shrub or tree, or in vines or on wires. The round, 3.8-to-5.1-centimetre (1.5 to 2.0 in) diameter nest is built of very small twigs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen" title="Lichen">lichen</a> and other mosses, and often lined with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_feather" title="Down feather">downy feathers</a> or animal hair. The nest materials are bound together with spider silk or other sticky materials. They are known to nest early as mid-December and as late as June.
Unlike most hummingbirds, the male Anna's Hummingbird sings during courtship. The song is thin and squeaky. During the breeding season, males can be observed performing a remarkable display, called a display dive, on their territories. The males also use the dive display to drive away rivals or intruders of other species. When a female flies onto a male's territory, he rises up approximately 30 metres (98&nbsp;ft) before diving over the recipient. As he approaches the bottom of the dive the males reach an average speed of 27&nbsp;m/s, which is 385 body lengths per second. At the bottom of the dive the male travels 23 metres per second (51&nbsp;mph), and produces a loud sound described by some as an "explosive squeak" with his outer tail-feathers.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Anna's Hummingbirds will sometimes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybridize</a> with other species, but this is not very common. These natural hybrids have been mistaken for new species. A bird, allegedly collected in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola%C3%B1os_(municipality)" title="Bolaños (municipality)" class="mw-redirect">Bolaños, Mexico</a>, was described and named <i>Selasphorus floresii</i> (Gould, 1861), or Floresi's Hummingbird. Several more specimens were collected in California over a long period, and the species was considered extremely rare.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> It was later determined that the specimens were the hybrid offspring of an Anna's Hummingbird and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_Hummingbird" title="Allen's Hummingbird">Allen's Hummingbird</a>. A single bird collected in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California" title="Santa Barbara, California">Santa Barbara, California</a>, was described and named <i>Trochilus violajugulum</i> (Jeffries, 1888), or Violet-throated Hummingbird.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> It was later determined to be a hybrid between an Anna's Hummingbird and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-chinned_Hummingbird" title="Black-chinned Hummingbird">Black-chinned Hummingbird</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
Anna's Hummingbirds are found along the western coast of North America, from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California" title="Baja California">Baja California</a>, and inland to southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>. They tend to be permanent residents within their range, and are very territorial.

Anna's hummingbirds are the only hummingbirds to spend the winter in northern climates; they are able to do this as there are enough winter flowers and food to support them. During cold temperatures, Anna's Hummingbirds gradually gain weight during the day as they convert sugar to fat.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> In addition, hummingbirds with inadequate stores of body fat or insufficient plumage are able to survive periods of sub-freezing weather by lowering their metabolic rate and entering a state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpor" title="Torpor">torpor</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
There are an estimated 1.5 million Anna's Hummingbirds. Their population appears to be stable, and they are not considered an endangered species.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
