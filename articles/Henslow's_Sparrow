Adults have streaked brown upperparts with a light brown breast with streaks, a white belly and a white throat. They have a pale stripe on the crown with a dark stripe on each side, an olive face and neck, rust-coloured wings and a short dark forked tail.

They <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a> and open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine" title="Pine">pine</a> woods in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States" title="Southeastern United States">southeastern United States</a>.

The range and numbers of this bird are decreasing, probably due to habitat loss.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> population was solely known from a 105-acre (0.42&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) brushfield near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston" title="Houston">Houston</a> and disappeared after devegetation due to industrial development in the 1980s. It was considered a distinct subspecies (<i>A. h. houstonensis</i>: Arnold, 1983) but is today considered to fall into the range of variation of the nominate subspecies (Browning, 1990). Likewise, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota" title="South Dakota">South Dakotan</a> population formerly known as <i>P. h. occidentalis</i> has been synonymized with the nominate. The only remaining subspecies generally (but not universally) accepted are the Eastern Henslow's Sparrow and the Western Henslow's Sparrow, whose ranges are for the most part separated by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains" title="Appalachian Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a>.
