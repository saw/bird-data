The <b>Black Oystercatcher</b> (<i>Haematopus bachmani</i>) is a conspicuous black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aves" title="Aves" class="mw-redirect">bird</a> found on the shoreline of western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. It ranges from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleutian_Islands" title="Aleutian Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> to the coast of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California_peninsula" title="Baja California peninsula">Baja California peninsula</a>.
The Black Oystercatcher is the only representative of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oystercatcher" title="Oystercatcher">oystercatcher</a> family (Haematopodidae) over most of its range, overlapping slightly with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Oystercatcher" title="American Oystercatcher">American Oystercatcher</a> (<i>H. palliatus</i>) on the coast of Baja California. Within its range it is most commonly referred to as the <b>Black Oystercatcher</b>, although this name is also used locally for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackish_Oystercatcher" title="Blackish Oystercatcher">Blackish Oystercatcher</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Oystercatcher" title="African Oystercatcher">African Oystercatcher</a>. Its scientific name is derived by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Audubon" title="John James Audubon">John James Audubon</a> from that of his friend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bachman" title="John Bachman">John Bachman</a>.
Although the species is not considered threatened, its global population size is estimated between 8,900–11,000 individuals. The Black Oystercatcher is a species of high conservation concern throughout its range (U.S., Canadian, Alaskan, and Northern &amp; Southern Pacific Shorebird Conservation Plans), a keystone indicator species along the north Pacific shoreline, a management <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_species" title="Indicator species">indicator species</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chugach_National_Forest" title="Chugach National Forest">Chugach National Forest</a>, and a U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service focal species for priority conservation action.
The Black Oystercatcher is a large entirely black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">shorebird</a>, with a long (9&nbsp;cm) bright red bill and pink legs. It has a bright yellow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" title="Iris (anatomy)">iris</a> and a red eye-ring. Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">plumage</a> varies slightly from north to south, being darker further north.
The Black Oystercatcher is restricted in its range, never straying far from shores, in particular favoring rocky shorelines. It has been suggested that this bird is seen mostly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_corridor" title="Wildlife corridor">coastal stretches</a> which have some quieter embayments, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetty" title="Jetty">jetty</a> protected areas. It forages in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertidal_zone" title="Intertidal zone">intertidal zone</a>, feeding on marine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a>, particularly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusc" title="Mollusc" class="mw-redirect">molluscs</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussel" title="Mussel">mussels</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpet" title="Limpet">limpets</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiton" title="Chiton">chitons</a>. It will also take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab" title="Crab">crabs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopod" title="Isopod" class="mw-redirect">isopods</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle" title="Barnacle">barnacles</a>. It hunts through the intertidal area, searching for food visually, often so close to the water's edge it has to fly up to avoid crashing surf. It uses its strong bill to dislodge food and pry shells open.
The Black Oystercatcher is a territorial bird during the nesting season, defending a foraging and nesting area in one territory. Some pairs have been recorded staying together for many years. Nests are small bowls or depressions close to the shore in which small pebbles and shell fragments are tossed in with a sideward or backard flick of the bill.
Around 2 to 3 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> are laid in this nest, these are very hard and can even survive being submerged by a high tide or very high water levels. Incubation takes around 26–28 days. The chicks are capable of leaving the nest after one day, and will stay in the territory for a long time after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledging</a> (40 days). The fledged juveniles will stay in the territory until the next breeding season. If the parents <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a>, that year's chicks will migrate with them; this happens more often in the north of the range.
