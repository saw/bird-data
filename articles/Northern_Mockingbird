The Northern Mockingbird is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore" title="Omnivore">omnivore</a>.

These birds forage on the ground or in vegetation; they also fly down from a perch to capture food. While foraging, they frequently spread their wings in a peculiar two-step motion to display the white patches. There is disagreement among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithologist" title="Ornithologist" class="mw-redirect">ornithologists</a> over whether this behavior is purely a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)" title="Territory (animal)">territorial</a> display, or whether the flashing white patches startles insects into giving up their cover.
Northern Mockingbird males establish a nesting territory in early February. If a female enters a male's territory, he will pursue the female with initially aggressive calls and if she becomes interested,she will reply with softer calls. Once the pair is established, their song becomes more gentle. Northern Mockingbirds tend to be monogamous, and the female may return to the same male from the previous season.
Both the male and female are involved in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation" title="Predation">predators</a>. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both the male and female will feed the chicks.
The birds aggressively defend their nests and surrounding areas against other birds and animals. When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds that are summoned by distinct calls from neighboring territories may join the attack. Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds harass the intruder. In addition to harassing domestic cats<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> and dogs they consider a threat, it is not unheard of for mockingbirds to target humans. The birds are absolutely unafraid and will attack much larger birds, even hawks. One famous incident in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma" title="Tulsa, Oklahoma">Tulsa, Oklahoma</a> involving a postal carrier resulted in the distribution of a warning letter to residents.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>
Northern Mockingbirds are famous for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the beginning of breeding season to attract females. <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The Mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. <sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male Mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males are also more likely to use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy" title="Monogamy">socially monogamous</a>, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.
An observational study by Logan demonstrates that the female is continuously evaluating the quality of the male and his territory. <sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory at the beginning of a new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male’s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuity" title="Promiscuity">extra-pair matings</a> do occur in Northern Mockingbirds.
Northern Mockingbirds adjust the sex ratio of their offspring according to the food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex at the beginning of a breeding season when the food is abundant. <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> birds, like the Northern Mockingbird, females are more likely to disperse than males. <sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philopatry" title="Philopatry">philopatric</a> sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense. Since Northern Mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments. It is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_steroid" title="Sex steroid">sexual hormones</a> and therefore play a role in offspring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_ratio" title="Sex ratio">sex ratio</a>. <sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>
Northern Mockingbirds are socially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a>. The two sexes look alike except that males are a little larger in size than females. Mutual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_choice" title="Mate choice">mate choice</a> is exhibited in Northern Mockingbirds. <sup id="cite_ref-defense_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-defense-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_investment" title="Parental investment">parental investment</a>. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber females breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their mates. In these cases, these female breeders have the option of changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.
Northern Mockingbirds are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" title="Altricial">altricial</a>. The young have a survival bottleneck at the nestling stage because there is higher level of nestling predation than egg predation. <sup id="cite_ref-defense_24-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-defense-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> The level of defense by the parents therefore increases once the egg hatches but there is no increase during the egg stage. A recent study shows that both food availability and temperature affect the parental <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubation</a> of the eggs in Northern Mockingbirds. <sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> Increasing food availability provides the females with more time to care for the nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.
Mockingbird nests are also often parasitized by other bird species. The parents are found to reject <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite" title="Brood parasite">parasitic eggs</a> at an intermediate rate. <sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> A recent study has shown that foreign eggs are more likely to be rejected from a nest later in the breeding season than from earlier in a breeding season. <sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet, so are less likely to reject foreign eggs. There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the Northern Mockingbirds and their parasites. If the breeding season of the parasites starts later, there is less likelihood of parasitism. Hence, it pays the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs.
Although many species of bird imitate other birds, the Northern Mockingbird is the best known in North America for doing so. It imitates not only birds but, it also imitates other animals and mechanical sounds such as car alarms. As convincing as these imitations may be to humans, they often fail to fool other birds, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Scrub-Jay" title="Florida Scrub-Jay" class="mw-redirect">Florida Scrub-Jay</a>.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from March 2012">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
The Northern Mockingbird's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry" title="Mimicry">mimicry</a> is likely to serve as a form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection" title="Sexual selection">sexual selection</a> through which competition between males and female choice influence a bird's song repertoire size.<sup id="cite_ref-JSTOR_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-JSTOR-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> It is also possible that the bird's variety of calls serve to drive away as many competing birds, of all species, as possible.<sup id="cite_ref-10000birds_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10000birds-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> The mockingbird is limited to imitating short units of sound, which it repeats several times before moving on to a new sound. As a result, the Mockingbird sounds much better (to a human ear) imitating some species than others. Species with repetitive songs, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Wren" title="Carolina Wren">Carolina Wren</a>, are effectively copied, but species with long, complex songs, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Sparrow" title="Song Sparrow">Song Sparrow</a>, cannot be effectively imitated by the mockingbird.
In a paper published in 2009, researchers found that mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, had approached and threatened the mockingbirds' nest. Researchers had one participant stand near a mockingbird nest and touch it, while others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup>
Northern Mockingbirds are a species that are found in both urban and rural habitats. There are now more Northern Mockingbirds living in urban habitats than non-urban environments and are consequently known as an urban-positive species.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Biologists have long questioned how Northern Mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities, and whether they fall into the typical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_trap" title="Ecological trap">ecological traps</a> that are common for urban-dwelling birds. A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the urban habitats. Lower food availability and travel costs may account for the higher mortality rate in rural habitats.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non-urban ones. For example, the lawns that are regularly mowed and the nest predation in urban neighborhoods and other open spaces are consistent over the years. The site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps.
A study conducted on the campus of University of Florida shows that Northern Mockingbirds are quick to identify individual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" title="Human">human</a> intruders (in around 60 seconds), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_distance" title="Escape distance">flush distance</a>, attack rates and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_call" title="Alarm call" class="mw-redirect">alarm calls</a> increase in intensity over four sequential days with the same human intruder. <sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> However, the mockingbirds do not demonstrate aggression towards every one of the hundreds of passers-byers on a daily basis. They seem to be able to detect the level of perceived risk and only take actions when the risk is high. This result shows the amazingly fast adaptability and flexibility of northern mockingbirds in an urban environment.
