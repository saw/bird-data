The common name comes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia" title="Savannah, Georgia">Savannah, Georgia</a>, where one of the first specimens of this bird was collected.

This species has a typically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparrow" title="Sparrow">sparrow</a>-like dark-streaked brown back, and whitish underparts with brown or blackish breast and flank streaking. It has whitish crown and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercilium" title="Supercilium">supercilium</a> stripes, sometimes with some yellow (more often near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">beak</a>). The cheeks are brown and the throat white. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">flight feathers</a> are blackish-brown with light brown or white border. The eyes are dark. The feet and legs are horn-colored, as is the lower part of the bill, with the upper part being dark grey.<sup id="cite_ref-byersetal1995_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-byersetal1995-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Savannah Sparrow is a very variable species, with numerous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>, several of which have been split as separate species at various times. The different forms vary principally in the darkness of the plumage. The variation generally follows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloger%27s_Rule" title="Gloger's Rule" class="mw-redirect">Gloger's Rule</a>, with Alaskan and interior races the palest, and southwestern coastal forms the darkest. There are some exceptions, though, most conspicuously in some island populations that presumably were strongly affected by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect" title="Founder effect">founder effects</a>. The general pattern of variation has a fairly clear divide, southwest of which the birds become notably darker; this agrees quite well with the limit between <i>P. sandwichensis</i> and <i>P. (s.) rostratus</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Savannah Sparrows show some variation in size across subspecies. The total length can range from 11 to 17 cm (4.3 to 6.7 in), wingspan ranges from 18 to 25 cm (7.1 to 9.8 in) and body mass from 15 to 29 g (0.53 to 1.0 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CRC_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> In the nominate subspecies, the body weight averages 20.1&nbsp;g (0.71&nbsp;oz).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Savannah Sparrows proper (see <a href="#Savannah_Sparrows_proper">below</a>) are very similar, and migrant birds can not usually be related to a breeding population with certainty. The resident or partially migratory subspecies are well distinguishable by size and, particularly between groups, coloration.<sup id="cite_ref-byersetal1995_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-byersetal1995-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
These birds forage on the ground or in low bushes; particularly in winter they are also found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grazing" title="Grazing">grazed</a> low-growth grassland. They mainly eat seeds, but also eat insects in the breeding season. They are typically encountered as pairs or family groups in the breeding season, and assemble in flocks for the winter migration. The flight call is a thin <i>seep</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-byersetal1995_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-byersetal1995-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensu_lato" title="Sensu lato" class="mw-redirect">Sensu lato</a></i>, the Savannah Sparrow is considered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_species" title="Threatened species">threatened species</a> by the IUCN.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The song is mixture of <i>chirps</i> and trills.
Seventeen subspecies (including the Large-billed Sparrows) are currently recognized, though many are only described from wintering birds and much of the variation seems to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(biology)" title="Cline (biology)">clinal</a>. Four additional subspecies are no longer generally accepted. The complex is usually divided into several groups:
All are migratory; wintering ranges overlap widely.
<i>P. s. wetmorei</i> is a doubtful subspecies that may breed in the mountains of Guatemala. It is known from only 5 specimens, collected June 11â€“17, 1897, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huehuetenango_Department" title="Huehuetenango Department">Huehuetenango Department</a>.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
