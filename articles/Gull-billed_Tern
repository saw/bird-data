The <b>Gull-billed Tern</b> (<i>Gelochelidon nilotica</i>) formerly <i>Sterna nilotica</i> (Bridge <i>et al.</i>, 2005), is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">tern</a> family Sternidae. It is now considered to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic" title="Monotypic" class="mw-redirect">its own</a> genus.
This is a fairly large and powerful tern, similar in size and general appearance to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich_Tern" title="Sandwich Tern">Sandwich Tern</a>, but the short thick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gull-like</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a>, broad wings, long legs and robust body are distinctive. The summer adult has grey upperparts, white underparts, a black cap, strong black bill and black legs. The call is a characteristic <i>ker-wik</i>. It is 33–42 cm (13–17 in) in length and 76–91 cm (30–36 in) in wingspan.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Body mass ranges from 150–292 g (5.3–10.3 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
In winter, the cap is lost, and there is a dark patch through the eye like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forster%27s_Tern" title="Forster's Tern">Forster's Tern</a> or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Gull" title="Mediterranean Gull">Mediterranean Gull</a>. Juvenile Gull-billed Terns have a fainter mask, but otherwise look much like winter adults.
Juvenile Sandwich Terns have a short bill, and are frequently mistaken for Gull-billed Tern where the latter species is uncommon, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> coasts.
It breeds in warmer parts of the world in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> (and a very small isolated population in northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>), temperate and eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, both coasts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> has a number of geographical races, differing mainly in size and minor plumage details.
All forms show a post-breeding dispersal, but the northern breeders are most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and northern South America, southern Asia and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>.
The Gull-billed Tern is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEWA" title="AEWA" class="mw-redirect">AEWA</a>) applies.
This species breeds in colonies on lakes, marshes and coasts. It nests in a ground scrape and lays two to five eggs. While widely distributed in freshwater areas in Eurasia, it is associated almost solely with saltwater, coastal areas in North America.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
This is a somewhat atypical tern, in appearance like a <i>Sterna</i> tern, but with feeding habits more like the <i>Chlidonias</i> marsh terns, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Tern" title="Black Tern">Black Tern</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-winged_Tern" title="White-winged Tern">White-winged Tern</a>. It used to be grouped in the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterna" title="Sterna">Sterna</a></i> but is now placed on its own in the genus <i>Gelochelidon</i>.
The Gull-billed Tern does not normally plunge dive for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> like the other white terns, and has a broader diet than most other terns. It largely feeds on insects taken in flight, and also often hunts over wet fields and even in brushy areas, to take amphibians and small mammals, as well as small birds and the chicks and eggs of other terns.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
