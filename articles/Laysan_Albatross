<i>Diomedea immutabilis</i>
The <b>Laysan Albatross</b> (<i>Phoebastria immutabilis</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> that ranges across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific" title="North Pacific" class="mw-redirect">North Pacific</a>. 99.7% of the population is found on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Hawaiian_Islands" title="Northwestern Hawaiian Islands">Northwestern Hawaiian Islands</a>. This small (for its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a>) two-tone gull-like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross" title="Albatross">albatross</a> is the second most common seabird in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands" title="Hawaiian Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a>, with an estimated population of 2.5 million birds, and is currently expanding (or possibly re-expanding) its range to new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islands" title="Islands" class="mw-redirect">islands</a>. The Laysan Albatross was first described as <i>Diomedea immutabilis</i> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Walter_Rothschild" title="Lionel Walter Rothschild" class="mw-redirect">Lionel Walter Rothschild</a>, in 1893, based on a specimen from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laysan_Island" title="Laysan Island" class="mw-redirect">Laysan Island</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Robertson_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Robertson-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
It is named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laysan" title="Laysan">Laysan</a>, one of its breeding colonies in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Hawaiian_Islands" title="Northwestern Hawaiian Islands">Northwestern Hawaiian Islands</a>.
The Laysan Albatross averages 81&nbsp;cm (32&nbsp;in) in length,<sup id="cite_ref-BLI_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BLI-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> and has a wingspan of 195–203 cm (77–80 in),.<sup id="cite_ref-Dunn_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunn-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Males, which weigh 2.4–4.1 kg (5.3–9.0 lb), being larger than females, which weigh 1.9–3.6 kg (4.2–7.9 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-Floyd_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Floyd-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CRC_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> This albatross has blackish-grey upperwing, mantle, back, upper rump, and tail, and their head, lower rump, and underparts are white. It has a black smudge around the eye, and its underwing pattern varies between individuals, with some having narrower black margins and variable amounts of black in the underwing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert" title="Covert" class="mw-redirect">coverts</a>. Finally, their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is pink with a dark tip. Juveniles have a grey bill and a dark upper rump.<sup id="cite_ref-BLI_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BLI-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> They do not have a breeding plumage.<sup id="cite_ref-Floyd_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Floyd-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Laysan Albatross is usually easy to identify, in the North Pacific it is simple to separate from the other relatively common albatross, the all black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-footed_Albatross" title="Black-footed Albatross">Black-footed Albatross</a>. It can be distinguished from the very rare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-tailed_Albatross" title="Short-tailed Albatross">Short-tailed Albatross</a> by its all dark back and smaller size. The Laysan Albatross' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> has been compared to that of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gull</a>, two tone with a dark grey mantle and wings, and white underside and head.
The Laysan Albatross has a wide range across the North Pacific with 16 nesting sites. 99.7% of the population is found on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Hawaiian_Islands" title="Northwestern Hawaiian Islands">Northwestern Hawaiian Islands</a>.Its main breeding colonies are in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands" title="Hawaiian Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a>, particularly the islands of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Atoll" title="Midway Atoll">Midway</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laysan" title="Laysan">Laysan</a>.

The Laysan Albatross is normally a silent bird, but on occasion they may be observed emitting long "moo"-ing sounds, descending whinnies, or rattles.<sup id="cite_ref-Floyd_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Floyd-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Female Laysan albatrosses bond for life, so they can cooperatively raise their young.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> A female Laysan Albatross known as "Wisdom" is the oldest known wild bird in the United States or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere" title="Northern Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>. "Wisdom" was banded by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Geological_Survey" title="U.S. Geological Survey" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Geological Survey</a> researcher in 1956, and in March 2011 was seen rearing a new chick on Midway Atoll. Because Laysan albatrosses can't breed until they are five years old, as of 2011 "Wisdom" is estimated to be at least 60 years old.<sup id="cite_ref-cnn11_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cnn11-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Laysan Albatross is colonial, nesting on scattered small islands and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoll" title="Atoll">atolls</a>, often in huge numbers, and builds different styles of nests depending on the surroundings, ranging from simple scoops in the sand<sup id="cite_ref-Ud_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ud-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> to nests using vegetation.<sup id="cite_ref-BLI_4-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BLI-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Laysan Albatrosses have a protracted breeding cycle, and breed annually, although some birds skip years.<sup id="cite_ref-BLI_4-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BLI-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Juvenile birds return to the colony three years after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledging</a>, but do not mate for the first time until seven or eight years old. During these four or five years they form pair bonds with a mate that they will keep for life. Courtship entails especially elaborate 'dances' that have up to 25 ritualized movements. Occasionally the birds form homosexual pairs consisting of two females. This has been observed in the colony on the Hawaiian island Oahu, where the sex-ratio of male to female is 2 to 3. Unpaired females pair up among themselves and successfully breed. Eggs are often fathered by paired males, who "cheat" on their spouse.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
The single egg is buff-white,<sup id="cite_ref-Ud_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ud-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> and it may have spots.<sup id="cite_ref-Peterson_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Peterson-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Both birds incubate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">egg</a>; the male does so first. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">Incubation</a> takes about 65 days, and is followed by several weeks of brooding, after which both parents are out at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea" title="Sea">sea</a> to provide for the growing chick. The chick takes about 160 days to fledge. This time investment by the parents may explain the long courtship; both parents want to be sure the other is serious. The chicks are fed a stomach oil by the parents.
The Laysan Albatross and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-footed_Albatross" title="Black-footed Albatross">Black-footed Albatross</a> have been known to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybridize</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Dunn_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunn-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Floyd_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Floyd-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Like all albatrosses, the Laysan Albatross is known to be long-living bird. The longest lifespan confirmed for a wild seabird was for a breeding male Laysan that was found to have been banded 53 years previously. Other albatross are thought to match or maybe even exceed this record but few confirmations of very old albatross exist.<sup id="cite_ref-Wood_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wood-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>

In the past harvesting for feathers was a major threat, along with high seas drift nets; however both of these have ceased, barring some small-scale illegal drift net operations.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_lead_poisoning" title="Animal lead poisoning">Lead poisoning</a> is killing thousands of Laysan Albatross each year on Midway Atoll, part of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument created by President George Bush in June 2006, and now known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papah%C4%81naumoku%C4%81kea_Marine_National_Monument" title="Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument">Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument</a>.

"Laysan chicks raised in nests close to 90 buildings left behind by the Navy are ingesting lead-based paint chips. This is causing shockingly high lead concentrations in their blood, leading to severe neurological disorders, and eventual death," said George Fenwick, President of American Bird Conservancy. "Federal funds are urgently needed to clean up this toxic mess to protect the Laysan Albatross as well as future visitors to the new Marine National Monument."<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>
Scientific studies<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vagueness" title="Wikipedia:Vagueness"><span title="You can help — from March 2011">vague</span></a></i>]</sup> have shown that Laysan Albatross chicks are eating lead-based paint chips peeling off of 95 aging buildings on the island; and that as many as 10,000 chicks, or five percent of hatched chicks, may be killed annually by exposure to lead-based paint. Many Laysan chicks that nest within five meters of building structures exhibit a condition referred to as "droopwing" which commonly manifests itself in the chicks’ inability to raise their wings, which drag on the ground resulting in broken bones and open sores. Chicks with droopwing will never be able to fly, and will die of starvation or dehydration. Other chicks within close proximity to buildings also suffer detrimental effects from lead exposure. These chicks have blood lead concentrations that cause immunological, neurological, and renal impairments, significantly decreasing their chances of survival.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior" title="United States Department of the Interior">Department of the Interior</a> (DOI) estimates that $5.6 million is needed to clean up the toxic lead paint on Midway Atoll. The 95 federally-owned government buildings must be stripped of all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead-based_paint" title="Lead-based paint" class="mw-redirect">lead-based paint</a>, and sand areas surrounding these old buildings need to be thoroughly sifted to remove lead paint chips. When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bird_Conservancy" title="American Bird Conservancy">American Bird Conservancy</a> staff presented the severity of this growing threat to an already-imperiled bird species to DOI officials, they were told that the new Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument did not have any federal funds dedicated to its operation. Moreover, the DOI officials stated that the current federal budget for the nation’s wildlife refuge system would be insufficient to prevent the continued ingestion of lead paint by Laysan chicks.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from March 2011">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
