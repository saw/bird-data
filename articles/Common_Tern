The <b>Common Tern</b><sup id="cite_ref-gill_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gill-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> (<i>Sterna hirundo</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">tern</a> family Sternidae. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> has a circumpolar distribution, its four <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> breeding in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperateness" title="Temperateness">temperate</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarctic" title="Subarctic">subarctic</a> regions of Europe, Asia and North America. It is strongly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering in coastal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics" title="Tropics">tropical</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics" title="Subtropics">subtropical</a> regions. Breeding adults have light grey upperparts, white to very light grey underparts, a black cap, orange-red legs, and a narrow pointed bill. Depending on the subspecies, the bill may be mostly red with a black tip or all black. There are a number of similar species, including the partly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatry" title="Sympatry">sympatric</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Tern" title="Arctic Tern">Arctic Tern</a>, which can be separated on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> details, leg and bill colour, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_communication" title="Animal communication">vocalisations</a>.
Breeding in a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives, the Common Tern nests on any flat, poorly vegetated surface close to water, including beaches and islands, and it readily adapts to artificial substrates such as floating rafts. The nest may be a bare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest#Scrape" title="Bird nest">scrape</a> in sand or gravel, but it is often lined or edged with whatever debris is available. Up to three eggs may be laid, their dull colours and blotchy patterns providing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage" title="Camouflage">camouflage</a> on the open beach. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_incubation#Avian_incubation" title="Egg incubation">Incubation</a> is by both sexes, and the eggs hatch in around 21–22 days, longer if the colony is disturbed by predators. The downy chicks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> in 22–28&nbsp;days. Like most terns, this species feeds by plunge-diving for fish, either in the sea or in freshwater, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusca" title="Mollusca">molluscs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a> and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrate</a> prey may form a significant part of the diet in some areas.
Eggs and young are vulnerable to predation by mammals such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_mink" title="American mink">American mink</a>, and large birds including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gulls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owls</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron" title="Heron">herons</a>. Common Terns may be infected by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louse" title="Louse">lice</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm" title="Parasitic worm">parasitic worms</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite" title="Mite">mites</a>, although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematozoa" title="Haematozoa">blood parasites</a> appear to be rare. Its large population and huge breeding range mean that this species is classed as being of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern" title="Least Concern">Least Concern</a>, although numbers in North America have declined sharply in recent decades. Despite international legislation protecting the Common Tern, in some areas populations are threatened by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction">habitat loss</a>, pollution or the disturbance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_colony" title="Bird colony">breeding colonies</a>.
The terns, family Sternidae, are small to medium-sized seabirds closely related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gulls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skimmer" title="Skimmer">skimmers</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skua" title="Skua">skuas</a>. They are gull-like in appearance, but typically have a lighter build, long pointed wings (which give them a fast, buoyant flight), a deeply forked tail, slender legs,<sup id="cite_ref-BWP764_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BWP764-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and webbed feet.<sup id="cite_ref-wassink_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wassink-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Most species are grey above and white below, and have a black cap which is reduced or flecked with white in the non-breeding season.<sup id="cite_ref-BWP764_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BWP764-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Common Tern was first described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus" title="Carl Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae" title="Systema Naturae">Systema Naturae</a></i> in 1758 under its current scientific name, <i>Sterna hirundo</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Linnaeus_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Linnaeus-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The word "stearn" was used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English" title="Old English">Old English</a> and a similar word was used by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisians" title="Frisians">Frisians</a> for tern.<sup id="cite_ref-OED_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OED-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> "Stearn" appears in the poem <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seafarer_(poem)" title="The Seafarer (poem)">The Seafarer</a></i>, written around 1000 AD.<sup id="cite_ref-OED_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OED-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Linnaeus adopted this word for the genus name <i>Sterna</i>. The Latin for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow" title="Swallow">swallow</a> is "hirundo" and refers here to the tern's superficial likeness to that unrelated bird, which has a similar light build and long forked tail.<sup id="cite_ref-hume12_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hume12-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> This resemblance also leads to the informal name "Sea Swallow",<sup id="cite_ref-rspb_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rspb-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> recorded from at least the seventeenth century.<sup id="cite_ref-hume12_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hume12-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_English" title="Scottish English">Scottish</a> names <i>pictar</i>, <i>tarrock</i> and their many variants are believed to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia" title="Onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a>, derived from the distinctive call.<sup id="cite_ref-hume12_9-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hume12-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Due to the difficulty in distinguishing the two species, all the informal common names are shared with the Arctic Tern.<sup id="cite_ref-cocker_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cocker-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
Four subspecies of the Common Tern are generally recognized, although <i>S.&nbsp;h.&nbsp;minussensis</i> is sometimes considered to be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergradation" title="Intergradation">intergrade</a> between <i>S.&nbsp;h.&nbsp;hirundo</i> and <i>S.&nbsp;h.&nbsp;longipennis</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-hume88_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hume88-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
The nominate subspecies of the Common Tern is 31–35&nbsp;cm (12.2–13.8&nbsp;in) long, including a 6–9&nbsp;cm (2.4–3.5&nbsp;in) fork in the tail, with a 77–98&nbsp;cm (31–39&nbsp;in) wingspan. It weighs 110–141&nbsp;g (3.9–5.0&nbsp;oz).<sup id="cite_ref-olsen_14-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-olsen-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Breeding adults have pale grey upperparts, very pale grey underparts, a black cap, orange-red legs, and a narrow pointed bill that can be mostly red with a black tip, or all black, depending on the subspecies.<sup id="cite_ref-hume21_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hume21-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> The Common Tern's upperwings are pale grey, but as the summer wears on, the dark feather shafts of the outer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">flight feathers</a> become exposed, and a grey wedge appears on the wings. The rump and tail are white, and on a standing bird the long tail extends no further than the folded wingtips, unlike the Arctic and Roseate Terns in which the tail protrudes beyond the wings. There are no significant differences between the sexes.<sup id="cite_ref-vinicombe_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vinicombe-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> In non-breeding adults the forehead and underparts become white, the bill is all black or black with a red base, and the legs are dark red or black.<sup id="cite_ref-vinicombe_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vinicombe-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> The upperwings have an obvious dark area at the front edge of the wing, the carpal bar. Terns that have not bred successfully may start <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulting" title="Moulting">moulting</a> into non-breeding adult plumage from June, but late July is more typical, with the moult suspended during migration. There is also some geographical variation, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">Californian</a> birds often being in non-breeding plumage during migration.<sup id="cite_ref-olsen_14-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-olsen-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
Juvenile Common Terns have pale grey upperwings with a dark carpal bar. The crown and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nape" title="Nape">nape</a> are brown, and the forehead is ginger, wearing to white by autumn. The upperparts are ginger with brown and white scaling, and the tail lacks the adult's long outer feathers.<sup id="cite_ref-olsen_14-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-olsen-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Birds in their first post-juvenile plumage, which normally remain in their wintering areas, resemble the non-breeding adult, but have a duskier crown, dark carpal bar, and often very worn plumage. By their second year, most young terns are either indistinguishable from adults, or show only minor differences such as a darker bill or white forehead.<sup id="cite_ref-harrison_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-harrison-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Common Tern is an agile flyer, capable of rapid turns and swoops, hovering, and vertical take-off. When commuting with fish, it flies close to the surface in a strong head wind, but 10–30&nbsp;m (30–90&nbsp;ft) above the water in a following wind. Unless migrating, normally it stays below 100&nbsp;m (300&nbsp;ft), and averages 30&nbsp;km/h (18.6&nbsp;mph) in the absence of a tail wind.<sup id="cite_ref-nisbet_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nisbet-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Its average flight speed during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal" title="Nocturnal" class="mw-redirect">nocturnal</a> migration flight is 43–54&nbsp;km/h (27–33&nbsp;mph)<sup id="cite_ref-alerstam_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-alerstam-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> at a height of 1,000–3,000&nbsp;m (3,200–9,700&nbsp;ft).<sup id="cite_ref-nisbet_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nisbet-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The juvenile starts moulting into adult plumage in its first October; the head, tail and body plumage is replaced first, mostly by February, then the wing feathers. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather#Primaries" title="Flight feather">primaries</a> are replaced in stages; the innermost feathers moult first, then replacement is suspended during the southern winter (birds of this age staying in their wintering areas) and recommences in the autumn. In May to June of the second year a similar moult sequence starts, with a pause during primary moult for birds that return north, but not for those that stay in the winter quarters. A major moult to adult breeding plumage occurs in the next February to June, between 40–90&nbsp;percent of feathers being replaced.<sup id="cite_ref-olsen_14-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-olsen-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Old primary feathers wear away to reveal the blackish barbs beneath. The moult pattern means that the oldest feathers are those nearest the middle of the wing, so as the northern summer progresses, a dark wedge appears on the wing due to this feather ageing process.<sup id="cite_ref-hume21_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hume21-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
Terns are unusual in the frequency in which they moult their primaries, which are replaced at least twice, occasionally three times in a year. The visible difference in feather age is accentuated in the greater <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> reflectance of new primaries, and the freshness of the wing feathers is used by females in mate selection.<sup id="cite_ref-bridgeeaton_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bridgeeaton-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> Experienced females tend to accept mates which best show their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology)" title="Fitness (biology)">fitness</a> through the quality of their wing feathers.<sup id="cite_ref-bridge2004_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bridge2004-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> Rarely, a very early moult at the nesting colony may be linked to breeding failure, both the onset of moult and reproductive behaviour being linked to falling levels of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone" title="Hormone">hormone</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin" title="Prolactin">prolactin</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-BB105_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BB105-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup>
There are several terns of a similar size and general appearance to the Common Tern. A traditionally difficult species to separate is the Arctic Tern, and until the key characteristics were clarified, distant or flying birds of the two species were often jointly recorded as "commic terns". Although similar in size, the two terns differ in structure and flight. The Common Tern has a larger head, thicker neck, longer legs, and more triangular and stiffer wings than its relative, and has a more powerful, direct flight.<sup id="cite_ref-BB86_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BB86-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> The Arctic Tern has greyer underparts than the Common, which make its white cheeks more obvious, whereas the rump of the Common Tern can be greyish in non-breeding plumage, compared to the white of its relative. The Common Tern develops a dark wedge on the wings as the breeding season progresses, but the wings of Arctic stay white throughout the northern summer. All the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">flight feathers</a> of the Arctic Tern are translucent against a bright sky, only the four innermost wing feathers of the Common Tern share this property.<sup id="cite_ref-BB86_23-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BB86-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-vanDuivendijk_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vanDuivendijk-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> The trailing edge of the outer flight feathers is a thin black line in the Arctic Tern, but thicker and less defined in the Common.<sup id="cite_ref-vinicombe_17-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vinicombe-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> The bill of an adult Common Tern is orange-red with a black tip, except in black-billed <i>S.&nbsp;h.&nbsp;longipennis</i>, and its legs are bright red, while both features are a darker red colour in the Arctic Tern, which also lacks the black bill tip.<sup id="cite_ref-BB86_23-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BB86-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>
In the breeding areas, the Roseate Tern can be distinguished by its pale plumage, long, mainly black bill and very long tail feathers.<sup id="cite_ref-vanDuivendijk_24-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vanDuivendijk-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> The non-breeding plumage of Roseate is pale above and white, sometimes pink-tinged, below. It retains the long tail streamers, and has a black bill.<sup id="cite_ref-olsen2_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-olsen2-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> In flight, the Roseate's heavier head and neck, long bill and faster, stiffer wingbeats are also characteristic.<sup id="cite_ref-Blomdahl_26-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blomdahl-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> It feeds further out to sea than the Common Tern.<sup id="cite_ref-olsen2_25-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-olsen2-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> In North America, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forster%27s_Tern" title="Forster's Tern">Forster's Tern</a> in breeding plumage is obviously larger than the Common, with relatively short wings, a heavy head and thick bill, and long, strong legs; in all non-breeding plumages, its white head and dark eye patch make the American species unmistakable.<sup id="cite_ref-olsen2_25-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-olsen2-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup>
In the wintering regions, there are also confusion species, including the Antarctic Tern of the southern oceans, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_American_Tern" title="South American Tern">South American Tern</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia" title="Australasia">Australasian</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-fronted_Tern" title="White-fronted Tern">White-fronted Tern</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-cheeked_Tern" title="White-cheeked Tern">White-cheeked Tern</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. Identification may be aided by the plumage differences due to "opposite" breeding seasons. The Antarctic Tern is more sturdy than the Common, with a heavier bill. In breeding condition, its dusky underparts and full black cap outline a white cheek stripe. In non-breeding plumages, it lacks, or has only an indistinct, carpal bar, and young birds show dark bars on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather#Tertials" title="Flight feather">tertials</a>, obvious on the closed wing and in flight.<sup id="cite_ref-Enticott196_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Enticott196-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-SASOL_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SASOL-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> The South American Tern is larger than the Common, with a larger, more curved red bill, and has a smoother, more extensive black cap in non-breeding plumage.<sup id="cite_ref-peru_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-peru-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> Like Antarctic, it lacks a strong carpal bar in non-breeding plumages, and it also shares the distinctive barring of the tertials in young birds.<sup id="cite_ref-Enticott192_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Enticott192-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> The White-fronted Tern has a white forehead in breeding plumage, a heavier bill, and in non-breeding plumage is paler below than the Common, with white underwings.<sup id="cite_ref-Simpson_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Simpson-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> The White-cheeked Tern is smaller, has uniform grey upperparts, and in breeding pumage is darker above with whiter cheeks.<sup id="cite_ref-grimmett_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-grimmett-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup>
Juvenile Common Terns are easily separated from similar-aged birds of related species. They show extensive ginger colouration to the back, and have a pale base to the bill. Young Arctic Terns have a grey back and black bill, and juvenile Roseate Terns have a distinctive scalloped "saddle".<sup id="cite_ref-vinicombe_17-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vinicombe-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">Hybrids</a> between Common and Roseate Terns have been recorded, particularly from the US, and the intermediate plumage and calls shown by these birds is a potential identification pitfall.

The Common Tern has a wide repertoire of calls, which have a lower pitch than the equivalent calls of Arctic Terns. The most distinctive sound is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_signal" title="Alarm signal">alarm</a> <i>KEE-yah</i>, stressed on the first syllable, in contrast to the second-syllable stress of the Arctic Tern. The alarm call doubles up as a warning to intruders, although serious threats evoke a <i>kyar</i>, given as a tern takes flight, and quietens the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger.<sup id="cite_ref-hume68_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hume68-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> A down-slurred <i>keeur</i> is given when an adult is approaching the nest while carrying a fish, and is possibly used for individual recognition (chicks emerge from hiding when they hear their parents giving this call). Another common call is a <i>kip</i> uttered during social contact. Other vocalizations include a <i>kakakakaka</i> when attacking intruders, and a staccato <i>kek-kek-kek</i> from fighting males.<sup id="cite_ref-hume68_33-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hume68-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup>
Parents and chicks can locate one another by call, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibling" title="Sibling">siblings</a> also recognise each other's vocalisations from about the twelfth day from hatching, which helps to keep the brood together.<sup id="cite_ref-sibling_34-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sibling-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Stevenson_35-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stevenson-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup>
Most populations of the Common Tern are strongly migratory, wintering south of their temperate and subarctic Northern Hemisphere breeding ranges.

As with many birds, the same site is re-used year after year, with a record of one pair returning for 17 successive breeding seasons. Around 90&nbsp;percent of experienced birds reuse their former territory, so young birds must nest on the periphery, find a bereaved mate, or move to another colony.<sup id="cite_ref-hume86_61-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hume86-61"><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup> A male selects a nesting territory a few days after his arrival in the spring, and is joined by his previous partner unless she is more than five days late, in which case the pair may separate.<sup id="cite_ref-solis_63-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-solis-63"><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup>
The defence of the territory is mainly by the male, who repels intruders of either sex. He gives an alarm call, opens his wings, raises his tail and bows his head to show the black cap. If the intruder persists, the male stops calling and fights by bill grappling until the intruder submits by raising its head to expose the throat. Aerial trespassers are simply attacked, sometimes following a joint upward spiralling flight.<sup id="cite_ref-hume86_61-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hume86-61"><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup> Despite the aggression shown to adults, wandering chicks are usually tolerated, whereas in a gull colony they would be attacked and killed. The nest is defended until the chicks have fledged, and all the adults in the colony will collectively repel potential predators.<sup id="cite_ref-hume79_64-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hume79-64"><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup>
Pairs are established or confirmed through aerial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship_display" title="Courtship display">courtship displays</a> in which a male and a female fly in wide circles up to 200&nbsp;m (600&nbsp;ft) or more, calling all the while, before the two birds descend together in zigzag glides. If the male is carrying a fish, he may attract the attention of other males too. On the ground, the male courts the female by circling her with his tail and neck raised, head pointing down, and wings partially open. If she responds, they may both adopt a posture with the head pointed skywards. The male may tease a female with the fish, not parting with his offering until she has displayed to him sufficiently.<sup id="cite_ref-hume91_65-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hume91-65"><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup> Once courtship is complete, the male makes a shallow depression in the sand, and the female scratches in the same place.

Terns are expert at locating their nests in a large colony. Studies show that terns can find and excavate their eggs when they are buried, even if the nest material is removed and the sand smoothed over. They will find a nest placed 5&nbsp;m (15&nbsp;ft) from its original site, or even further if it is moved in several stages. Eggs are accepted if reshaped with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticine" title="Plasticine">plasticine</a> or coloured yellow (but not red or blue). This ability to locate the eggs is an adaptation to life in an unstable, wind-blown and tidal environment.<sup id="cite_ref-Fisher_54-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fisher-54"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup>
