<i>Nyctea Scandiaca</i> <small>Stephens, 1826</small>
The <b>Snowy Owl</b> (<i>Bubo scandiacus</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owl</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typical_owl" title="Typical owl" class="mw-redirect">typical owl</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> Strigidae. The Snowy Owl was first classified in 1758 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolus_Linnaeus" title="Carolus Linnaeus" class="mw-redirect">Carolus Linnaeus</a>, the Swedish naturalist who developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature" title="Binomial nomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a> to classify and organize plants and animals. Until recently, it was regarded as the sole member of a distinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a>, as <i><b>Nyctea</b> scandiaca</i>, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MtDNA" title="MtDNA" class="mw-redirect">mtDNA</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_b" title="Cytochrome b">cytochrome <i>b</i></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequence" title="DNA sequence" class="mw-redirect">sequence</a> data (Olsen <i>et al.</i> 2002) shows that it is very closely related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horned_owl" title="Horned owl">horned owls</a> in the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubo_(genus)" title="Bubo (genus)" class="mw-redirect">Bubo</a></i>. The Snowy Owl is the official bird of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a>.
This yellow-eyed, black-beaked white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> is easily recognizable. It is 52–71 centimetres (20–28 in) long, with a 125–150 centimetres (49–59 in) wingspan. Also, these birds can weigh anywhere from 1.6 to 3 kilograms (3.5 to 6.6 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It is one of the largest species of owl and, in North America, is on average the heaviest owl species. The adult male is virtually pure white, but females and young birds have some dark scalloping; the young are heavily barred, and dark spotting may even predominate. Its thick plumage, heavily feathered taloned feet, and colouration render the Snowy Owl <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(biology)" title="Adaptation (biology)" class="mw-redirect">well-adapted</a> for life north of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle" title="Arctic Circle">Arctic Circle</a>.
Snowy Owl calls are varied, but the alarm call is a barking, almost quacking <i>krek-krek</i>; the female also has a softer mewling <i>pyee-pyee</i> or <i>prek-prek</i>. The song is a deep repeated <i>gawh</i>. They may also clap their beak in response to threats or annoyances. While called clapping, it is believed this sound may actually be a clicking of the tongue, not the beak.
The Snowy Owl is typically found in the northern circumpolar region, where it makes its summer home north of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_parallel_north" title="60th parallel north">latitude 60 degrees north</a>. However, it is a particularly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadic" title="Nomadic" class="mw-redirect">nomadic</a> bird, and because population fluctuations in its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey" title="Prey" class="mw-redirect">prey</a> species can force it to relocate, it has been known to breed at more southerly latitudes. During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial" title="Last glacial" class="mw-redirect">last glacial</a>, there was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe" title="Central Europe">Central Europe</a> <i>Bubo scandiacus gallicus</i>, but no modern subspecies are recognized.
This species of owl nests on the ground, building a scrape on top of a mound or boulder. A site with good visibility, ready access to hunting areas, and a lack of snow is chosen. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(river_morphology)" title="Bar (river morphology)">Gravel bars</a> and abandoned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle" title="Eagle">eagle</a> nests may be used. Breeding occurs in May, and depending on the amount of prey available, clutch sizes range from 5 to 14 eggs, which are laid singly, approximately every other day over the course of several days. Hatching takes place approximately five weeks after laying, and the pure white young are cared for by both parents. Both the male and the female defend the nest and their young from predators. Some individuals stay on the breeding grounds while others migrate.
Snowy Owls nest in the Arctic tundra of the northermost stretches of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. They winter south through Canada and northern Eurasia, with irruptions occurring further south in some years. Snowy Owls are attracted to open areas like coastal dunes and prairies that appear somewhat similar to tundra. They have been reported as far south as the American states of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a>, the American Gulf states, southernmost Russia, and northern China.
Between 1967 and 1975, Snowy Owls bred on the remote island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetlar" title="Fetlar">Fetlar</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland_Isles" title="Shetland Isles" class="mw-redirect">Shetland Isles</a> north of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Females summered as recently as 1993, but their status in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> is now that of a rare winter visitor to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland" title="Shetland">Shetland</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Hebrides" title="Outer Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairngorms" title="Cairngorms">Cairngorms</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
In January 2009, a Snowy Owl appeared in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the first reported sighting in the state since 1987.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> More notable is the huge mass southern migration in the winter of 2011/2012, when thousands of Snowy Owls were spotted in various locations across the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
This powerful bird relies primarily on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings" title="Lemmings" class="mw-redirect">lemmingss</a> and other small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent" title="Rodent">rodents</a> for food during the breeding season, but at times of low prey density, or during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagopus" title="Lagopus">ptarmigan</a> nesting period, they may switch to favoring juvenile ptarmigan. They are opportunistic hunters and prey species may vary considerably, especially in winter. They feed on a wide variety of small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadow_vole" title="Meadow vole" class="mw-redirect">meadow voles</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_mice" title="Deer mice" class="mw-redirect">deer mice</a>, but will take advantage of larger prey, frequently following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_trapping" title="Animal trapping">traplines</a> to find food. Some of the larger mammal prey includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare" title="Hare">hares</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskrat" title="Muskrat">muskrats</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot" title="Marmot">marmots</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel" title="Squirrel">squirrels</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit" title="Rabbit">rabbits</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon" title="Raccoon">raccoons</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_dog" title="Prairie dog">prairie dogs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(animal)" title="Mole (animal)">moles</a>, and entrapped furbearers. Birds preyed upon include ptarmigan, other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck" title="Duck">ducks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geese" title="Geese" class="mw-redirect">geese</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorebird" title="Shorebird" class="mw-redirect">shorebirds</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheasants" title="Pheasants" class="mw-redirect">pheasants</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grouse" title="Grouse">grouse</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coot" title="Coot">coots</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grebe" title="Grebe">grebes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gulls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbirds</a>, and even other raptors, including other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owl</a> species. Most of the owls' hunting is done in the "sit and wait" style; prey may be captured on the ground, in the air or fish may be snatched off the surface of bodies of water using their sharp talons. Each bird must capture roughly 7 to 12 mice per day to meet its food requirement and can eat more than 1,600 lemmings per year.
Snowy Owls, like many other birds, swallow their small prey whole. Strong stomach juices digest the flesh, while the indigestible bones, teeth, fur, and feathers are compacted into oval pellets that the bird regurgitates 18 to 24 hours after feeding. Regurgitation often takes place at regular perches, where dozens of pellets may be found. Biologists frequently examine these pellets to determine the quantity and types of prey the birds have eaten. When large prey are eaten in small pieces, pellets will not be produced.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
Though Snowy Owls have few predators, the adults are very watchful and are equipped to defend against any kind of threat towards them or their offspring. During the nesting season, the owls regularly defend their nests against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_fox" title="Arctic fox">arctic foxes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvid" title="Corvid" class="mw-redirect">corvids</a> and swift-flying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skua" title="Skua">jaegers</a>; as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" title="Dog">dogs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolves" title="Gray wolves" class="mw-redirect">gray wolves</a> and avian predators. Males defend the nest by standing guard nearby while the female incubates the eggs and broods the young. Both sexes attack approaching predators, dive-bombing them and engaging in distraction displays to draw the predator away from a nest. They also compete directly for lemmings and other prey with several predators, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough-legged_Hawk" title="Rough-legged Hawk" class="mw-redirect">Rough-legged Hawks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Eagle" title="Golden Eagle">Golden Eagles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_Falcon" title="Peregrine Falcon">Peregrine Falcons</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrfalcon" title="Gyrfalcon">Gyrfalcons</a>, jaegers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucous_Gull" title="Glaucous Gull">Glaucous Gulls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-eared_Owl" title="Short-eared Owl">Short-eared Owls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Horned_Owl" title="Great Horned Owl">Great Horned Owls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Eagle_Owl" title="Eurasian Eagle Owl" class="mw-redirect">Eurasian Eagle Owls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Raven" title="Common Raven">Common Ravens</a>, wolves, arctic foxes, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ermine" title="Ermine" class="mw-redirect">ermine</a>. They are normally dominant over other raptors although may (sometimes fatally) lose in conflicts to large raptors such as other <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horned_owl" title="Horned owl">Bubo</a></i> owls, Golden Eagles and the smaller but much faster Peregrine Falcons. Some species nesting near Snowy Owl nests, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Goose" title="Snow Goose">Snow Goose</a>, seem to benefit from the incidental protection of snowy owls that drive competing predators out of the area.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
