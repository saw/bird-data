The Eskimo or the "Northern Curlew" is a critically endangered shorebird, now considered by many to be extinct.
The Eskimo Curlew is one of eight species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curlew" title="Curlew">curlew</a>, and is classed with them in the genus <i>Numenius</i>. It was formerly placed in the separate genus <i>Mesoscolopax</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-AOU_SA_list_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AOU_SA_list-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>Numenius</i> is classed in the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scolopacidae" title="Scolopacidae" class="mw-redirect">Scolopacidae</a>. Other species in that family include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodcock" title="Woodcock">woodcocks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalarope" title="Phalarope">phalaropes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snipe" title="Snipe">snipes</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandpiper" title="Sandpiper">sandpipers</a>. Scolopacidae is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charadriiformes" title="Charadriiformes">Charadriiform</a> lineage.
The species was described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Reinhold_Forster" title="Johann Reinhold Forster">Johann Reinhold Forster</a> in 1772.<sup id="cite_ref-Zoonomen_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Zoonomen-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The generic name has three possible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology" title="Etymology">etymologies</a>. One is that it comes from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> "<i>noumenios</i>". "<i>Noumenios</i>" means "of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_the_moon" title="Phases of the moon" class="mw-redirect">new moon</a>", the curlews' thin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">beak</a> being compared to a thin crescent moon.<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_p769_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres_p769-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> A second possibility is that the genus name comes from the word <i>numen</i>, meaning "nod", and referring to this species head being bent forwards and down. The final possibility is that <i>Numenius</i> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinization_(literature)" title="Latinization (literature)" class="mw-redirect">Latinized</a> form of the Greek <i>noumenios</i>, which was the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_Laertius" title="Diogenes Laertius" class="mw-redirect">Diogenes Laertius</a> used to refer to a species of curlew. The specific name "<i>borealis</i>" is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language" title="Latin language" class="mw-redirect">Latin</a> for "northern".<sup id="cite_ref-USGS_names_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-USGS_names-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species has many common names. It has been named the <b>Prairie Pigeon</b>, <b>Fute</b>, <b>Little Curlew</b>, <b>Doe-bird</b>, and <b>Doughbird</b>. These last two names come from its fatness during early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migration</a> south.<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_p776_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres_p776-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eskimo Curlews are small curlews, about 30&nbsp;centimeters in length.<sup id="cite_ref-EllisNTB178_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-EllisNTB178-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Adults have long dark greyish legs and a long bill curved slightly downwards. The upperparts are mottled brown and the underparts are light brown. They show cinnamon wing linings in flight. They are similar in appearance to the Hudsonian Curlew, the American subspecies of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whimbrel" title="Whimbrel">Whimbrel</a>, but smaller in size. In the field, the only certain way to distinguish the Eskimo Curlew are its unbarred undersides of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remiges" title="Remiges" class="mw-redirect">primaries</a> (Townsend, 1933). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_call" title="Bird call" class="mw-redirect">call</a> is poorly understood, but includes clear whistling sounds.<sup id="cite_ref-Gollop_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gollop-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eskimo Curlew formed a species pair with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asian</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Curlew" title="Little Curlew">Little Curlew</a>, <i>Numenius minutus</i>, but is slightly larger, longer-winged, shorter legged and warmer in plumage tone than its Asian relative.
The Eskimo Curlew is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a> bird. Members of this species bred on the tundra of western arctic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>.
Eskimo Curlews <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrated</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pampas" title="Pampas">pampas</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> in the late summer and returned in February.<sup id="cite_ref-EllisNTB178_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-EllisNTB178-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> They were formerly very rare vagrants to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, but there have been no recent records. In Britain, there are four records, all from the 19th Century.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
A comparison of dates and migratory patterns has led some to conjecture that Eskimo Curlews and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Golden_plover" title="American Golden plover" class="mw-redirect">American Golden-Plover</a> are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorebirds" title="Shorebirds" class="mw-redirect">shorebirds</a> that attracted the attention of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> to nearby land after 65 days at sea and out of sight of land on his first voyage. In the 1800s millions of Eskimo Curlews followed migration routes from the present <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon_Territory" title="Yukon Territory" class="mw-redirect">Yukon</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territories" title="Northwest Territories">Northwest Territories</a>, flying east along the northern shore of Canada, then south over the Atlantic Ocean to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> in the winter. When returning to North America, they would fly north through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains" title="Great Plains">Great Plains</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaufman_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kaufman-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eskimo Curlews picked up food by sight, as well as feeding by probing. They eat mostly berries while on the fall migration in Canada. During the rest of their migration and on the breeding grounds they ate insects. Snails and other invertebrate were also part of their diet during migration.
Nesting probably occurred in June. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">Nests</a> were located in open areas on the ground and are difficult to locate. They were made of wisps of dried grass or leaves. The eggs are green with brown splotches.<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_p776_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres_p776-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species' specific <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubation</a> behavior is unknown.<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_p776_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres_p776-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> It is not certain which sex if not both incubated, and what the specific timeline was. These birds evidently did not attack intruders approaching their nests, which provides reason to believe that their nests were far apart from each other.<sup id="cite_ref-USGS_life_history_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-USGS_life_history-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
At one time, the Eskimo Curlew may have been one of the most numerous shorebirds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> with a population in the millions. As many as 2 million birds per year were killed near the end of the 19th century. The last confirmed sightings were in 1962 on Galveston Island, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> (photographed) and on Barbados in 1963 (specimen). There was a reliable report of 23 birds in Texas in 1981, and more recent additional unconfirmed reports from Texas, Canada (1987), Argentina (1990), and Nova Scotia (2006). No confirmed record of this species has been reported in South America since 1939. Full details on all sightings up to 1986 are included in the on line edition of <i>Eskimo Curlew: A Vanishing Species?</i>
This species is fully protected in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.
