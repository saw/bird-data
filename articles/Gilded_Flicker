The <b>Gilded Flicker</b> (<i>Colaptes chrysoides</i>) is a large-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> (mean length of 29&nbsp;cm (11&nbsp;in)) of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoran_Desert" title="Sonoran Desert">Sonoran</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuma_Desert" title="Yuma Desert">Yuma</a>, and eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Desert" title="Colorado Desert">Colorado Desert</a> regions of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">southwestern</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and northwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> including all of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_Peninsula" title="Baja Peninsula" class="mw-redirect">Baja Peninsula</a> except the extreme northwestern region. Golden yellow underwings distinguish the Gilded Flicker from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Flicker" title="Northern Flicker">Northern Flicker</a> found within the same region, which have red underwings.
The Gilded Flicker most frequently builds its nest hole in a majestic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saguaro" title="Saguaro">saguaro</a> cactus, excavating a nest hole nearer the top than the ground.<sup id="cite_ref-audubon_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-audubon-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The cactus defends itself against water loss into the cavity of the nesting hole by secreting sap that hardens into a waterproof structure that is known as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saguaro_boot" title="Saguaro boot">saguaro boot</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Northern Flickers, on the other hand, nest in riparian trees and very rarely inhabit saguaros. Gilded Flickers occasionally hybridize with Northern Flickers in the narrow zones where their range and habitat overlap.
