The <b>Elf Owl</b> (<i>Micrathene whitneyi</i>) is a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owl</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typical_owl" title="Typical owl" class="mw-redirect">Strigidae</a>, that breeds in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">southwestern United States</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. It is the world's lightest owl, although the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-whiskered_Owlet" title="Long-whiskered Owlet">Long-whiskered Owlet</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamaulipas_Pygmy_Owl" title="Tamaulipas Pygmy Owl">Tamaulipas Pygmy Owl</a> are of a similarly diminutive length.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The mean body weight of this species is 40&nbsp;grams (1.4&nbsp;oz). These tiny owls are 12.5 to 14.5&nbsp;cm (4.7-5.5&nbsp;in) long and have a wingspan of about 27&nbsp;cm (10.6&nbsp;in).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather#Primaries" title="Flight feather">primary projection</a> extends nearly past their tail. They have fairly long legs and often appear bow-legged. They can often be heard calling to one another just after dusk or at sunset. Their call is a high-pitched whinny or chuckle. The male and female dart around trees and call back and forth.
Elf Owls usually choose abandoned, north-facing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> cavities in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saguaro_cacti" title="Saguaro cacti" class="mw-redirect">Saguaro cacti</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sycamore" title="Sycamore">sycamores</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus_sect._Aegiros" title="Populus sect. Aegiros" class="mw-redirect">cottonwoods</a> and other hardwood trees, to raise their young. The female usually lays three round white eggs. The eggs are incubated for about 3 weeks before the chicks hatch. The young owlets fledge at about 10 weeks. Usually, chicks are born in mid-June or early July. By the end of July, they are almost always fledged and ready to set out on their own.
They are often found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaparral" title="Chaparral">chaparral</a>, and are easily found during their breeding season. They live in cacti much like some birds, using the shade and climate the tree provides.
Elf Owls usually are not aggressive and play "possum" in any dangerous situation, especially when a threatening animal comes inside their Saguaro cactus.
The elf owl migrates to Arizona and New Mexico in the spring and summer. In the winter, it is found in central and southern Mexico. Migrant Elf Owls return north in mid-August or early May. It is also known as Mae Rose.
Elf Owls feed mainly on insects and therefore occupy habitats with a ready supply of these. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agave" title="Agave">Agaves</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocotillo" title="Ocotillo" class="mw-redirect">ocotillos</a> are ideal places for foraging as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth" title="Moth">moths</a> and other insects may sleep in their flowers. They are often seen chasing after flying insects, with a flight similar to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher" title="Tyrant flycatcher">tyrant flycatcher</a>'s just after dusk.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from August 2012">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
In the wild, Elf Owls live 3–6&nbsp;years. In captivity they usually live longer, between 6–10&nbsp;years.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from August 2012">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
