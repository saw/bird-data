The Maui parrotbill is one of the larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_honeycreeper" title="Hawaiian honeycreeper">Hawaiian honeycreepers</a>, measuring 14 centimetres (5.5&nbsp;in)<sup id="cite_ref-BirdLife_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdLife-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and with a mass of 20–25 grams (0.71–0.88 oz). The bird is yellow on the breast, cheeks, and belly, olive-green on the wings, crown, tail, and back, and has a bright yellow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercilium" title="Supercilium">supercilium</a>.

The Maui parrotbill is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy" title="Monogamy">monogamous</a> and breeds between November and June.

Pairs raise a single nestling per season. The female incubates it for 16 days. Fledglings remain with their parents for five to eight months as they learn how to forage.<sup id="cite_ref-FWS_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FWS-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>

As far as anyone can determine, <i>Pseudonestor xanthophrys</i> had not historically had a common name in the Hawaiian language. The name Hawaiian <i>kiwikiu</i> was developed by the Hawaiian Lexicon Committee, who was contacted by the Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project to select an appropriate name. A naming ceremony was held in the bird's habitat in September 2010. The "kiwi" part of the name means bent or curved (e.g., sickle-shaped), which refers to the shape of the bill of this bird. "Kiu" has a double meaning, referring both to the bird's secretive ways and to a cold, chilly wind, such as the breezes in the bird's habitat.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Maui parrotbill's natural <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_tropical_rainforests#Mixed_mesic_forests" title="Hawaiian tropical rainforests">mesic</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_tropical_rainforests#Wet_forests" title="Hawaiian tropical rainforests">wet forests</a>. It is threatened by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_loss" title="Habitat loss" class="mw-redirect">habitat loss</a>. Much of the land in the parrotbill's historic range was changed for agricultural purposes, timber production and animal grazing. Introduced pests, such as mosquitoes, rats, and feral ungulates directly and indirectly affect the parrotbill's survival. Mosquitoes spread avian malaria, which the parrotbill is susceptible to, rats prey upon the birds' eggs and young, and feral pigs uproot the low-lying vegetation that the parrotbill forages in. Pigs additionally create wallows, which serve as breeding grounds for avian malaria-infected mosquitoes.
The Maui parrotbill was listed as an endangered species in 1967 under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act" title="Endangered Species Act">Endangered Species Act</a>. It is also part of the Maui-Molokai Bird Recovery Plan in 1984, which led to fencing areas of East Maui and removing feral ungulates. The recovery plan also included a captive breeding program, which produced its first chick in 2003. Field research is primarily done by the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://mauiforestbirds.org">Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project</a>.
A 2009 survey of the Waikamoi Preserve estimates that there are about 20 birds per square kilometer in the windward preserve near the summit of Haleakala, indicating that the population is holding steady or possibly increasing. A contributing factor is that native shrub cover in Waikamoi has tripled in the past 15 years. A previous study found about half the density. The preserve contains about 25 percent of the population, while most of the rest is in the Hanawi Natural Area Reserve. The birds were once found throughout Maui and Molokai.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
