The male of the nominate race, <i>C. c. cyaneus</i> (Linnaeus, 1766), which breeds in Europe and Asia, is mainly grey above and white below except for the upper breast, which is grey like the upperparts, and the rump, which is white; the wings are grey with black wingtips. The female is brown above with white upper tail coverts, hence females, and the similar juveniles, are often called "ringtails". Their underparts are buff streaked with brown.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>

In winter, the Hen Harrier is a bird of open country, and will then roost communally, often with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(bird)" title="Merlin (bird)">Merlins</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_Harrier" title="Marsh Harrier">Marsh Harriers</a>.

This is a typical harrier, which hunts long wings held in a shallow V in its low flight during which the bird closely hugs the contours of the land below them. Northern or Hen Harriers hunt primarily small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, as do most harriers. Preferred prey species can include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vole" title="Vole">voles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_rat" title="Cotton rat">cotton rats</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_squirrel" title="Ground squirrel">ground squirrels</a>. Up to 95% of the diet is comprised by small mammals.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> However <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a> are hunted with some regularity as well, especially by males. Preferred avian prey include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerines</a> of open country (i.e. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparrow" title="Sparrow">sparrows</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lark" title="Lark">larks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipit" title="Pipit">pipits</a>), small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorebird" title="Shorebird" class="mw-redirect">shorebirds</a> and the young of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfowl" title="Waterfowl">waterfowl</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galliformes" title="Galliformes">galliforms</a>.

Little information is available on longevity in Hen or Northern Harriers. It is known that the longest lived known bird was 16 years and 5 months. However, even adults rarely live more than 8 years. Mortality in the early stages of life is often related to predation. Predators of eggs and nestlings include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon" title="Raccoon">raccoons</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk" title="Skunk">skunks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badger" title="Badger">badgers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox" title="Fox">foxes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvus_(genus)" title="Corvus (genus)" class="mw-redirect">crows and ravens</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" title="Dog">dogs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owls</a>. Fledgings are also predated regularly, especially by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Horned_Owl" title="Great Horned Owl">Great Horned Owls</a> in North America.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> If a potential predator visits, both parents respond aggressively, issuing alarm calls and striking with talons. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-eared_Owl" title="Short-eared Owl">Short-eared Owls</a> are natural enemies of this species that favor the same prey and habitat, as well as having a similarly broad distribution. Occasionally, both harriers and Short-eared Owls will harrass each other until the victim it drops its prey and it can be stolen, a practice known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptoparasitism" title="Kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitism</a>. Most commonly, the harriers are the aggressors whom pirate prey away from the owls than vica versa.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species has a large range, with an estimated global extent 1–20 million km², and a population estimated at 1.3 million individuals. There is evidence of a population decline, but the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List</a> (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). It is therefore classified as "least concern".<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
In some parts of Europe people believed that seeing a harrier perched on a house was a sign that three people would die; on a happier note, some Native American tribes believe that seeing a hawk on your wedding day is a sign of a long, happy marriage. Unlike many raptors, Hen or Northern Harriers have historically been favorably regarded by farmers because they eat predators of quail eggs and mice that damage crops. Harriers are sometimes called "good hawks" because they pose no threat to poultry as some hawks do. Heavy pesticide use in the 1970s and 1980s caused a decline in harrier populations.<sup id="cite_ref-TexasPWD2012_7-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TexasPWD2012-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, the Hen Harrier suffers illegal persecution by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamekeeper" title="Gamekeeper">gamekeepers</a> and their employers on shooting estates, particularly those managed for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Grouse" title="Red Grouse">Red Grouse</a> shooting, resulting in local and regional extinction in many areas, particularly in England where only 4 breeding pairs survive despite abundant suitable habitat capable of holding several hundred pairs.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-birdguides_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-birdguides-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-nwcu_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nwcu-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Because of this they are now very rare in many parts of the UK, and under threat in many more areas.<sup id="cite_ref-rspb1_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rspb1-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-rspb2_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rspb2-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-rspb3_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rspb3-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>

Since the assumed threat to Red Grouse is the main reason for the persecution of this species in the UK, a project funded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Natural_Heritage" title="Scottish Natural Heritage">Scottish Natural Heritage</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_%26_Wildlife_Conservation_Trust" title="Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust">Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSPB" title="RSPB" class="mw-redirect">RSPB</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_England" title="Natural England">Natural England</a> was launched at Langholm Moor in Scotland from 2007. The Langholm Moor Demonstration Project (LMDP), a 10-year investigation, costing £3 million, is intended to see whether grouse and raptors can live side-by-side harmoniously.
A similar project, the Joint Raptor Study (also referred to as the 'JRS' or 'the Langholm Study') was run on Langholm from 1992 to 1997. The study made many findings and a host of peer reviewed papers were published on the work, in addition to the final report. Among the most often quoted findings were that long term declines in red grouse populations were "extremely unlikely" to be due to raptor predation and were attributed to habitat degradation/loss, and that raptor predation was the most likely explanation for the failure of grouse stocks to recover at Langholm once the population had fallen to a low level.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> The project ended in 1997, although a follow up supplementary feeding trial was run by the same team in 1998 and 1999. Grouse shooting on the moor was abandoned for the 1998 season onwards.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Hen Harrier is a bird of open habitats such as heather moorland and extensive agriculture. However, much of its range, particularly in Ireland and parts of western Britain, has been (and continues to be) afforested, predominantly with non-native conifers such as Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis) from North America (Barton et al. 2006,<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> Fielding et al. 2010<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup>). Hen Harriers nest and forage in commercial forestry when it is young, before the canopy closes (typically at between 9–12 and years old), but do not make much use of thicket and subsequent growth stages (Madders 2000,<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> O'Donoghue 2004<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup>), which typically comprise between two thirds and three quarters of the commercial growth cycle. Where forests replace habitats that were used by Hen Harriers they will therefore tend to reduce overall habitat availability (O'Flynn, 1983<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup>). However, where afforestation takes place in areas that were previously underutilised by Hen Harriers, it may increase the value of such areas to this species in the long-term (Wilson et al. 2009,<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> Haworth &amp; Fielding 2009<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup>). Areas dominated by forestry may remain suitable to Hen Harriers provided that a mosaic of age classes is maintained within the forest, such that areas of young, pre-thicket forest are always available.
