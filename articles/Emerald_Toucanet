The <b>Emerald Toucanet</b> (<i>Aulacorhynchus prasinus</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-passerine" title="Near-passerine" class="mw-redirect">near-passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> occurring in mountainous regions from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> and along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a> as far south as central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>. Some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxa" title="Taxa" class="mw-redirect">taxa</a> currently included in this species are sometimes split into separate species (<i>see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Toucanet#Taxonomy" title="Emerald Toucanet">Taxonomy</a></i>).
Like other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toucan" title="Toucan">toucans</a>, the Emerald Toucanet is brightly marked and has a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a>. The adult is 30–35 centimetres (12–14 in) long and weight can range from 118–230 grams (4.2–8.1 oz)<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The sexes are alike in appearance, although the female generally is smaller and slightly shorter-billed. It is, as other members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulacorhynchus" title="Aulacorhynchus" class="mw-redirect">Aulacorhynchus</a></i>, mainly green. The vent and tail-tip are rufous. The bill is black with yellow to the upper mandible (amount depends on the exact <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>) and, in all except the nominate (<i>prasinus</i>) and <i>wagleri</i> groups (<i>see Taxonomy</i>), a white band at the base of the bill. The members of the <i>caeruleogularis</i> group have a rufous patch near the base of the upper mandible, while some members of the <i>albivitta</i> group have a rufous patch near the base of the lower mandible. The throat is white in the nominate and the <i>wagleri</i> group, blue in the <i>caeruleogularis</i> and <i>cognatus</i> group, pale grey-blue in the <i>lautus</i> group, blue or black in the <i>atrogularis</i> group, and white or grey-blue in the <i>albivitta</i> group. The eye-ring ranges from blue to red, in some subspecies very dark, almost appearing blackish from a distance. The legs are dull greyish and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" title="Iris (anatomy)">iris</a> is dark.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_(organism)" title="Juvenile (organism)">Juveniles</a> are duller, incl. the throat, and, depending on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>, the black areas of the bill are replaced with dusky or the bill is entirely yellowish.
The Emerald Toucanet is a generally common in humid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forest</a> and woodland, mainly at higher elevations. The 3–4 white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a> are laid in an unlined hole in a tree, usually an old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a>, but sometimes a natural cavity. Both sexes incubate the eggs for 14–15 days, and the chicks remain in the nest after hatching. They are blind and naked at birth, and have short bills and specialised pads on their heels to protect them from the rough floor of the nest. They are fed by both parents, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> after about 6 weeks. They are fed for several weeks after leaving the nest.
Small flocks, usually consisting of 5–10 birds, move through the forest in "follow-my-leader" style with a direct and rapid flight. This species is primarily an arboreal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frugivore" title="Frugivore">fruit-eater</a>, but will also take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard" title="Lizard">lizards</a>, bird eggs, and other small prey.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_call" title="Bird call" class="mw-redirect">calls</a> of the Emerald Toucanet are a loud dry <i>rrip rrip rrip rrip rrip</i> and a <i>graval graval graval</i>. It has been suggested that the two different calls are given by the two sexes. There are also croaking alarm and aggression calls.
It has been suggested that the Emerald Toucanet actually should be split into 7 species (below described as they roughly occur from north to south):
These splits are mainly based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphology</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> as described by Navarro <i>et al.</i> (2001).<sup id="cite_ref-Navarro2001_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Navarro2001-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Their results were preliminary, as they themselves pointed out. As a result most authorities, notably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_American_Classification_Committee" title="South American Classification Committee" class="mw-redirect">SACC</a>, do not recognize more than a single widespread species, but recognize the need for a solution to this complex.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> They are clearly separate species as per the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_species_concept" title="Phylogenetic species concept" class="mw-redirect">phylogenetic species concept</a>, but judging the species limits as per the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_species_concept" title="Biological species concept" class="mw-redirect">biological species concept</a> is difficult due to the entirely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric" title="Allopatric" class="mw-redirect">allopatric</a> distributions of the various groups.<sup id="cite_ref-Navarro2001_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Navarro2001-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> There are no major vocal differences between the various populations, but that in itself is not unusual for separate species that do not overlap.<sup id="cite_ref-Navarro2001_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Navarro2001-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics" title="Genetics">Genetic</a> evidence has to some extent supported the above splits, although with different borders between the species in the northern Andes, and of the above suggested species, data is lacking for <i>lautus</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Bonaccorso2011_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bonaccorso2011-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-PueblaOlivares2008_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PueblaOlivares2008-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> According to their genetic results, the north Ecuadorian toucanets, which are white-throated and usually included in <i>albivitta</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-Ecuador_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ecuador-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> are closer to the <i>atrogularis</i> group than "true" <i>albivitta</i> of Colombia and Venezuela.<sup id="cite_ref-PueblaOlivares2008_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PueblaOlivares2008-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Assuming this is correct, it seems likely that north Ecuadorian toucanets represent a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon" title="Taxon">taxon</a>, which should be treated as a subspecies of <i>A. atrogularis</i>. They also found that <i>griseigularis</i> was closer to the <i>atrogularis</i> group than <i>albivitta</i>, but unlike the north Ecuadorian toucanets, they opted for treating it as a separate species, the Grey-throated or Plumbeous-throated Toucanet (<i>A. griseigularis</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-Bonaccorso2011_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bonaccorso2011-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-PueblaOlivares2008_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PueblaOlivares2008-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> In that case, <i>A. albivitta</i> is known as the White-throated Toucanet.<sup id="cite_ref-Bonaccorso2011_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bonaccorso2011-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> If <i>albivitta</i> and <i>griseigularis</i> are treated as separate species, it is unclear where <i>phaeolaemus</i> belongs, as genetic data for that taxon is missing. In appearance and distribution <i>phaeolaemus</i> is closest to <i>griseigularis</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> but inexplicably it has been suggested it should be treated as a subspecies of <i>A. albivitta</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Bonaccorso2011_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bonaccorso2011-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> In 2011 it was also suggested that <i>cyanolaemus</i> should be treated as a subspecies of <i>A. albivitta</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-Bonaccorso2011_6-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bonaccorso2011-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> but this was presumably an error, as it directly contradicts genetic data, which place it in <i>A. atrogularis</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-PueblaOlivares2008_7-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PueblaOlivares2008-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
Another potential problem relates to the distribution limit between <i>A. cognatus</i> and <i>A. caeruleogularis</i> in Panama. Although the reason for this treatment is unclear, the population in central Panama has been placed in <i>A. caeruleogularis</i>, which would limit <i>A. cognatus</i> to extreme eastern Panama and adjacent Colombia.<sup id="cite_ref-Bonaccorso2011_6-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bonaccorso2011-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-PueblaOlivares2008_7-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PueblaOlivares2008-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> According to George Angehr, author of <i>The Birds of Panama</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> it is possible toucanets from central Panama actually are closer to <i>A. cognatus</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Emerald Toucanet is a popular pet toucan. It is affectionate when hand-fed and loves to play and interact with its owner. Emerald Toucanets are as quick to learn tricks as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockatoo" title="Cockatoo">cockatoos</a>. They are active and need a large cage for their size, including perches that they can hop back and forth on. They also require a high-fruit diet, without which they are susceptible to a disease of excessive iron storage that is similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemochromatosis" title="Hemochromatosis" class="mw-redirect">hemochromatosis</a> in humans.
