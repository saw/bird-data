The Pileated Flycatcher (Xenotriccus mexicanus) is a species of bird in the Tyrannidae family; it is endemic to western Mexico (Garcia et. al.). It is a small bird with gray feathers, white chest, yellow beak and a pointed gray-feathered tip on the top if its head. The flycatcher’s natural habitat is subtropical forest, but during the summer it is found in tropical high-altitude scrubland. Their dietary preferences consist mainly of insects. The cause of deforestation has highly effected the Pileated Flycatcher’s population; it is now at a mere 20,000 to 50,000 birds, making it near threatened. Although the flycatcher has not reached the stage of endangerment, it has reached the stage of being nearly threatened. According to Dictionary.com, a threatened species is, “a species likely, in the near future, to become an endangered species within all or much of its range.” The flycatcher could reach the state of endangered if the act of deforestation for land use continues. Deforestation is the process of clearing trees to make space for other uses. Some uses for the cleared land include cattle ranching, farming, commercial products and other commodities. Natural resources that forests have to offer help the production of many goods and the use of vast land helps farmers man their cattle to be later used for sale to big time commercial industries. The clearing of space has increased every year around the world and is the cause of many species becoming nearly threatened, endangered and also contributes to some becoming extinct, including the Pileated Flycatcher who is put on the nearly threatened list. Clearing of forest trees and surroundings has negatively affected the Pileated Flycatcher and other species. With the loss of trees, the flycatcher has lost its place to live and create nests to care for their eggs and young. Deforestation also contributes to the loss of other species including insects, which is the dominant source of food for the flycatcher. The Pileated Flycatcher, indigenous to different areas of Mexico, depending on the season, has become nearly threatened with a population reaching up to 50,000. With the continuation of deforestation for a wide variety of uses, the flycatcher will be well on its path from nearly threatened to becoming endangered. Survival for this species will become very unlikely if the destruction of their habitat continues. Many groups and organizations, for years, have been specializing in preventing deforestation but industries continue to clear land therefore effecting the survival of many species including the Pileated Flycatcher.
