The <b>Brown Thrasher</b> (<i>Toxostoma rufum</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> in the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimidae" title="Mimidae" class="mw-redirect">Mimidae</a>, which also includes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_catbird" title="New World catbird" class="mw-redirect">New World catbirds</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockingbird" title="Mockingbird">mockingbirds</a>.

As a member of the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxostoma" title="Toxostoma">Toxostoma</a></i>, the bird is a large-sized thrasher. It has brown upper parts with a white under part with dark streaks. Because of this, it is often confused with the smaller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_Thrush" title="Wood Thrush">Wood Thrush</a>, among other species. The Brown Thrasher is noted for having over 1000 song types, and the largest song repertoire of birds.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> However, each note is usually repeated in two or three phrases.
The Brown Thrasher is an omnivore, with its diet ranging from insects to fruits and nuts. The usual nesting areas are shrubs, small trees, or at times on ground level. Brown Thrashers are generally inconspicuous but territorial birds, especially when defending their nests, and will attack species as large as humans.<sup id="cite_ref-helm02_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-helm02-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Brown Thrasher was originally described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolus_Linnaeus" title="Carolus Linnaeus" class="mw-redirect">Linnaeus</a> in his 18th century work <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae" title="Systema Naturae">Systema Naturae</a></i> as <i>Turdus rufus</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The species name is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> adjective <i>rufus</i> "red".
Although not in the thrush family, this bird is sometimes erroneously called the Brown Thrush.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The name misconception could be because the word <i>thrasher</i> is believed to derive from the word <i>thrush</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Mobley09_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mobley09-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The naturalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Catesby" title="Mark Catesby">Mark Catesby</a> called it the Fox-coloured Thrush.<sup id="cite_ref-helm01_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-helm01-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
