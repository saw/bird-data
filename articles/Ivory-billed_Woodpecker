<i>Picus principalis</i> <small>Linnaeus, 1758</small>
The <b>Ivory-billed Woodpecker</b> (<i>Campephilus principalis</i>) is one of the largest woodpeckers in the world, at roughly 20&nbsp;inches in length and 30&nbsp;inches in wingspan. It was native to the virgin forests of the southeastern United States (along with a separate subspecies native to Cuba). Due to habitat destruction, and to a lesser extent hunting, its numbers have dwindled to the point where it is uncertain whether any remain.
The species is listed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_endangered" title="Critically endangered" class="mw-redirect">critically endangered</a> and possibly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct" title="Extinct" class="mw-redirect">extinct</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN).<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The American Birding Association (ABA) lists the Ivory-billed Woodpecker as a Class 6 species, a category the ABA defines as "definitely or probably extinct."<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Reports of at least one male Ivory-billed Woodpecker in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> in 2004 were investigated and subsequently published in April 2005 by a team led by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Lab_of_Ornithology" title="Cornell Lab of Ornithology">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a> (Fitzpatrick <i>et al.</i>, 2005). No definitive confirmation of those reports emerged, despite intensive searching over five years following the initial sightings.
A $10,000 reward was offered in June 2006 for information leading to the discovery of an Ivory-billed Woodpecker nest, roost or feeding site.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In December 2008, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology announced a reward of $50,000 to the person who can lead a project biologist to a living Ivory-billed Woodpecker.
In late September 2006, a team of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithologist" title="Ornithologist" class="mw-redirect">ornithologists</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_University" title="Auburn University">Auburn University</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Windsor" title="University of Windsor">University of Windsor</a> published reports of their own sightings of Ivory-billed Woodpeckers along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choctawhatchee_River" title="Choctawhatchee River">Choctawhatchee River</a> in northwest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>, beginning in 2005 (Hill <i>et al.</i>, 2006). These reports were accompanied by evidence that the authors themselves considered suggestive for the existence of Ivory-billed Woodpeckers. Searches in this area of Florida through 2009 failed to produce definitive confirmation.
Despite these high-profile reports from Arkansas and Florida and sporadic reports elsewhere in the historic range of the species since the 1940s, there is no conclusive evidence for the continued existence of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker; i.e., there are no unambiguous photographs, videos, specimens or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> samples from feathers or feces of the Ivory-billed. Land acquisition and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a> restoration efforts have been initiated in certain areas where there is a relatively high probability that the species may have survived to protect any possible surviving individuals.
The Ivory-billed is the type species for the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campephilus" title="Campephilus">Campephilus</a></i>, a group of large American woodpeckers. Although the Ivory-billed looks very similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileated_Woodpecker" title="Pileated Woodpecker">Pileated Woodpeckers</a> they are not close relatives as the latter is a member of the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryocopus" title="Dryocopus">Dryocopus</a></i>.
Ornithologists have traditionally recognized two subspecies of this bird: the American Ivory-billed, the more famous of the two, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Ivory-billed_Woodpecker" title="Cuban Ivory-billed Woodpecker">Cuban Ivory-billed Woodpecker</a>. The two look similar despite differences in size and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a>. There is some controversy over whether the Cuban Ivory-billed Woodpecker is more appropriately recognized as a separate species. A recent study compared DNA samples taken from specimens of both Ivory-billed birds along with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Woodpecker" title="Imperial Woodpecker">Imperial Woodpecker</a>, a larger but otherwise very similar bird. It concluded not only that the Cuban and American Ivory-billed woodpeckers are genetically distinct, but also that they and the Imperial form a North American clade within <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campephilus" title="Campephilus">Campephilus</a></i> that appeared in the Mid-Pleistocene.<sup id="cite_ref-ancientDNA_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ancientDNA-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The study does not attempt to define a lineage linking the three birds, though it does imply that the Cuban bird is more closely related to the Imperial.<sup id="cite_ref-ancientDNA_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ancientDNA-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The American Ornithologists' Union Committee on Classification and Nomenclature has said it is not yet ready to list the American and Cuban as separate species. Lovette, a member of the committee, said that more testing is needed to support that change, but concluded that "These results will likely initiate an interesting debate on how we should classify these birds."<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Before this study, it was thought that the Cuban Ivory-billed were descended from mainland woodpeckers, either introduced to Cuba by Native Americans or accidentals that flew to the island themselves.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
While recent evidence suggesting that American Ivory-billed Woodpeckers may still exist in the wild has caused excitement in the Ornithology community, no similar evidence exists for the Cuban Ivory-billed bird, believed to be extinct since the last sighting in the late 1980s.
The Ivory-billed Woodpecker ranks among the largest woodpeckers in the world and the largest in the United States. The closely related and likewise possibly extinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Woodpecker" title="Imperial Woodpecker">Imperial Woodpecker</a> (<i>C. imperialis</i>) of western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> is, or was, the largest woodpecker. The Ivory-billed has a total length of 48 to 53 cm (19 to 21 in) and, based on very scant information, weighs about 450 to 570 g (0.99 to 1.3 lb). It has a typical 76&nbsp;cm (30&nbsp;in) wingspan. Standard measurements attained included a wing chord length of 23.5–26.5 cm (9.3–10.4 in), a tail length of 14–17 cm (5.5–6.7 in), a bill length of 5.8–7.3 cm (2.3–2.9 in) and a tarsus length of 4–4.6 cm (1.6–1.8 in).<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The bird is shiny blue-black with white markings on its neck and back and extensive white on the trailing edge of both the upper- and underwing. The underwing is also white along its forward edge, resulting in a black line running along the middle of the underwing, expanding to more extensive black at the wingtip. In adults, the bill is ivory in color, chalky white in juveniles. Ivory-bills have a prominent crest, although in juveniles it is ragged. The crest is black in juveniles and females. In males, the crest is black along its forward edge, changing abruptly to red on the side and rear. The chin of an ivory-bill is black. When perched with the wings folded, ivory-bills of both sexes present a large patch of white on the lower back, roughly triangular in shape. These characteristics distinguish it from the smaller and darker-billed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileated_Woodpecker" title="Pileated Woodpecker">Pileated Woodpecker</a>. The Pileated normally is brownish-black, smoky, or slaty black in color. It also has a white neck stripe but the back is normally black. Pileated juveniles and adults have a red crest and a white chin. Pileateds normally have no white on the trailing edges of their wings and when perched normally show only a small patch of white on each side of the body near the edge of the wing. However, Pileated Woodpeckers, apparently aberrant individuals, have been reported with white trailing edges on the wings, forming a white triangular patch on the lower back when perched. Like all woodpeckers, the ivory-bill has a strong and straight bill and a long, mobile, hard-tipped, barbed tongue. Among North American woodpeckers, the ivory-bill is unique in having a bill whose tip is quite flattened laterally, shaped much like a beveled wood chisel.
The bird's drum is a single or double rap. Four fairly distinct calls are reported in the literature and two were recorded in the 1930s. The most common, a kent or hant, sounds like a toy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet" title="Trumpet">trumpet</a> often repeated in series. When the bird is disturbed, the pitch of the kent note rises, it is repeated more frequently, and is often doubled. A conversational call, also recorded, is given between individuals at the nest, and has been described as <i>kent-kent-kent</i>.
The Ivory-billed Woodpecker is sometimes referred to as the <b>Grail Bird</b>, the <b>Lord God Bird</b>, or the <b>Good God Bird</b>, all based on the exclamations of awed onlookers.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Other nicknames for the bird are <b>King of the Woodpeckers</b> and <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis" title="Elvis" class="mw-redirect">Elvis</a> in Feathers</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
Ivory-billeds are known to prefer thick hardwood swamps and pine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forests</a>, with large amounts of dead and decaying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree" title="Tree">trees</a>. Prior to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, much of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Southern_states" title="U.S. Southern states" class="mw-redirect">Southern United States</a> was covered in vast tracts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primeval_forest" title="Primeval forest" class="mw-redirect">primeval hardwood forests</a> that were suitable as habitat for the bird. At that time, the Ivory-billed Woodpecker ranged from east <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>, and from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> After the Civil War, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging" title="Logging">timber industry</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforested</a> millions of acres in the South, leaving only sparse isolated tracts of suitable habitat.
The Ivory-billed Woodpecker feeds mainly on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva" title="Larva">larvae</a> of wood-boring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle" title="Beetle">beetles</a>, but also eats <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a>, and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>. The bird uses its enormous white bill to hammer, wedge, and peel the bark off dead trees to find the insects. These birds need about 25&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (9.7&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) per pair so they can find enough food to feed their young and themselves. Hence they occur at low densities even in healthy populations. The more common <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileated_Woodpecker" title="Pileated Woodpecker">Pileated Woodpecker</a> may compete for food with this species.
The Ivory-billed Woodpecker is thought to pair for life. Pairs are also known to travel together. These paired birds will mate every year between January and May. they excavate a nest in a dead or partially dead tree about 8–15m from the ground before they have their young. Usually two to five <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a> are laid and incubated for 3 to 5 weeks. Both parents sit on the eggs and are involved in taking care of the chicks, with the male taking sole responsibility at night. They feed the chicks for months. Young learn to fly about seven to eight weeks after hatching. The parents will continue feeding them for another two months. The family will eventually split up in late fall or early winter.
Ornithologists speculate that they may live as long as 30 years.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
Heavy logging activity exacerbated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting" title="Hunting">hunting</a> by collectors devastated the population of Ivory-billed Woodpeckers in the late 19th century. It was generally considered extinct in the 1920s when a pair turned up in Florida, only to be shot for specimens.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
By 1938, an estimated 20 individuals remained in the wild, some 6-8 of which were located in the old-growth forest called the Singer Tract in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, where logging rights were held by the Chicago Mill and Lumber Company. The company brushed aside pleas from four Southern governors and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audubon_Society" title="National Audubon Society">National Audubon Society</a> that the tract be publicly purchased and set aside as a reserve, and clearcut the forest. By 1944 the last known Ivory-billed Woodpecker, a female, was gone from the cut-over tract (<i>Smithsonian</i> p 98).
The Ivory-billed Woodpecker was listed as an endangered species on 11 March 1967, though the only evidence of its existence at the time was a possible recording of its call made in East Texas. The last reported sighting of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuban</a> subspecies (<i>C. p. bairdii</i>), after a long interval, was in 1987; it has not been seen since. The Cuban Exile journalist and author John O'Donnell-Rosales, who was born in the area of Cuba with the last confirmed sightings, reported sightings near the Alabama coastal delta in 1994, but these were never properly<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs clarification or removal of jargon from January 2011">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> investigated by state wildlife officials.
Two tantalizing photos were given to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University" title="Louisiana State University">Louisiana State University</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum" title="Museum">museum</a> director George Lowery in 1971 by a source who wished to remain anonymous but who came forward in 2005 as outdoorsman Fielding Lewis.<sup id="cite_ref-lection_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-lection-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
The photos, taken with a cheap <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instamatic" title="Instamatic">Instamatic</a> camera, show what appears to be a male Ivory-billed perched on the trunks of two different trees in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atchafalaya_Basin" title="Atchafalaya Basin">Atchafalaya Basin</a> of Louisiana. The bird's distinctive bill is not visible in either photo and the photos&nbsp;– taken from a distance&nbsp;– are very grainy. Lowery presented the photos at the 1971 annual meeting of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists_Union" title="American Ornithologists Union" class="mw-redirect">American Ornithologists Union</a>. Skeptics dismissed the photos as frauds; seeing that the bird is in roughly the same position in both photos, they suggested they may have been of a mounted specimen.
There were numerous unconfirmed reports of the bird,<sup id="cite_ref-SKeith_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SKeith-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Mendenhall_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mendenhall-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> but many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithology" title="Ornithology">ornithologists</a> believed the species had been wiped out completely, and it was assessed as "extinct" by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Conservation_Union" title="World Conservation Union" class="mw-redirect">International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources</a> in 1994. This assessment was later altered to "critically endangered" on the grounds that the species could still be extant.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
In 1999, there was an unconfirmed sighting of a pair of birds in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_(Mississippi-Louisiana)" title="Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)" class="mw-redirect">Pearl River</a> region of southeast Louisiana by a forestry student, David Kulivan, which some experts considered very compelling. In a 2002 expedition in the forests, swamps, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayou" title="Bayou">bayous</a> of the Pearl River Wildlife Management Area by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University" title="Louisiana State University">LSU</a>, biologists spent 30 days searching for the bird.<sup id="cite_ref-NatGeogNews_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NatGeogNews-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>
In the afternoon of 27 January 2002, after ten days, a rapping sound similar to the "double knock" made by the Ivory-billed Woodpecker was heard and recorded. The exact source of the sound was not found because of the swampy terrain, but signs of active woodpeckers were found (i.e., scaled bark and large tree cavities). The expedition was inconclusive, however, as it was determined that the recorded sounds were likely gunshot echoes rather than the distinctive double rap of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker.<sup id="cite_ref-Birdscope_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Birdscope-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>
Since 2002, most of the attention in the search for the Ivory-billed Woodpecker has turned away from the Pearl River region, although several unconfirmed sightings have been reported there since February 2006, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://fishcrow.com/index.html">video clips</a>.
A group of seventeen authors headed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Lab_of_Ornithology" title="Cornell Lab of Ornithology">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a> reported the discovery of at least one Ivory-billed Woodpecker, a male, in the Big Woods area of Arkansas in 2004 and 2005, publishing the report in the journal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal)" title="Science (journal)"><i>Science</i></a> on 28 April 2005 (Fitzpatrick <i>et al.</i>, 2005).
One of the authors, who was kayaking in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_River_National_Wildlife_Refuge" title="Cache River National Wildlife Refuge">Cache River National Wildlife Refuge</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_County,_Arkansas" title="Monroe County, Arkansas">Monroe County, Arkansas</a>, on 11 February 2004, reported on a website the sighting of an unusually large red-crested woodpecker. This report led to more intensive searches in the area and in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_River_National_Wildlife_Refuge" title="White River National Wildlife Refuge">White River National Wildlife Refuge</a>, undertaken in secrecy for fear of a stampede of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird-watcher" title="Bird-watcher" class="mw-redirect">bird-watchers</a>, by experienced observers over the next fourteen months. About fifteen sightings occurred during the period (seven of which were considered compelling enough to mention in the scientific article), possibly all of the same bird. One of these more reliable sightings was on 27 February 2004. Bobby Harrison of Huntsville, Alabama and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Gallagher" title="Tim Gallagher">Tim Gallagher</a> of Ithaca, New York, both reported seeing an ivory-billed woodpecker at the same time. The secrecy of the search permitted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_Conservancy" title="The Nature Conservancy">The Nature Conservancy</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a> to quietly buy up Ivory-billed habitat to add to the 120,000 acres (490&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of the Big Woods protected by the Conservancy.
A large woodpecker was videotaped on 25 April 2004; its size, wing pattern at rest and in flight, and white plumage on its back between the wings were cited as evidence that the woodpecker sighted was an Ivory-billed Woodpecker. That same video included an earlier image of what was suggested to be such a bird perching on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Tupelo" title="Water Tupelo" class="mw-redirect">Water Tupelo</a> (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupelo" title="Tupelo">Nyssa</a> aquatica</i>).
The report also notes that drumming consistent with that of Ivory-billed Woodpecker had been heard in the region. It describes the potential for a thinly distributed population in the area, though no birds have been located away from the primary site. A current concern is that many bird enthusiasts will rush to the area in an attempt to catch a glimpse of this rare bird. Ornithologists and veteran birders tell of adult woodpeckers abandoning their nests and young out of alarm at the encroachments of overenthusiastic birdwatchers.
In the fall of 2006, researchers developed and installed an "autonomous observatory" using robotic video cameras with image processing software that detects and records high resolution video of birds in flight inside a high probability zone in the Cache River area. As of August 2007, hundreds of birds have been recorded, including pileated woodpeckers, but not the Ivory-billed woodpecker.
In June 2005, ornithologists at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kansas" title="University of Kansas">University of Kansas</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gulf_Coast_University" title="Florida Gulf Coast University">Florida Gulf Coast University</a> submitted a scientific article skeptical of the initial reports of rediscovery.
We were very skeptical of the first published reports, and ... data were not sufficient to support this startling conclusion.
In August 2005, despite the arguments for the existence of at least one Ivory-billed Woodpecker, questions about the evidence remained. For example, there were no findings of dead Ivory-bills nor were any nests found. Cornell could not say with absolute certainty that the sounds recorded in Arkansas were made by Ivory-bills.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Some skeptics, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Prum" title="Richard Prum">Richard Prum</a>, believe the video could have been of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileated_Woodpecker" title="Pileated Woodpecker">Pileated Woodpecker</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup>
An article by Dina Cappiello in the Houston Chronicle published 18 December 2005 presented Richard Prum's position as follows:
Prum, intrigued by some of the recordings taken in Arkansas' Big Woods, said the evidence thus far is refutable.
On page 13 of "Winging It" (November/December 2005), the American Birding Association announced:
The ABA Checklist Committee has not changed the status of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker from Code 6 (EXTINCT) to another level that would reflect a small surviving population. The Committee is waiting for unequivocal proof that the species still exists.
In a commentary published in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Auk" title="The Auk">The Auk</a></i> in January 2006, ornithologist Jerome Jackson expressed his skepticism of the Ivory-bill evidence:
Prum, Robbins, Brett Benz, and I remain steadfast in our belief that the bird in the Luneau video is a normal Pileated Woodpecker. Others have independently come to the same conclusion, and publication of independent analyses may be forthcoming [...] For scientists to label sight reports and questionable photographs as 'proof' of such an extraordinary record is delving into 'faith-based' ornithology and doing a disservice to science." (Jackson, 2006a),
sparking off a side debate coming close to personal accusation (Fitzpatrick <i>et al.</i>, 2006b,c; Jackson, 2006b).
In March 2006, a research team headed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Sibley" title="David A. Sibley" class="mw-redirect">David A. Sibley</a> of Concord, MA published findings in the journal <i>Science</i>, saying that the videotape was most likely of a Pileated Woodpecker, with mistakes having been made in the interpretation of its posture. They conclude that it lacks certain features of an Ivory-billed Woodpecker, and has others consistent with the Pileated (Sibley <i>at al.</i>, 2006) The original Cornell research team stood by their original findings in a response article in the same issue of <i>Science</i>, stating:
Claims that the bird in the Luneau video is a normal pileated woodpecker are based on misrepresentations of a pileated's underwing pattern, interpretation of video artifacts as plumage pattern, and inaccurate models of takeoff and flight behavior. These claims are contradicted by experimental data and fail to explain evidence in the Luneau video of white dorsal plumage, distinctive flight behavior, and a perched woodpecker with white upper parts." (Fitzpatrick <i>et al.</i>, 2006a)
Other workers made claims disputing the validity of the Luneau video, including a web site discussing the evidence by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colby_College" title="Colby College">Colby College</a> biologist Louis Bevier, who stated:<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>
In sum, no evidence confirms the alleged rediscovery of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker. Indeed, confidence in the claim has eroded with failure to verify its existence despite massive searches.
A 2007 paper concluded that the Luneau video was consistent with the Pileated Woodpecker:<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup>
New video analysis of Pileated Woodpeckers in escape flights comparable to that of the putative Ivory-billed Woodpecker filmed in Arkansas shows that Pileated Woodpeckers can display a wingbeat frequency equivalent to that of the Arkansas bird during escape flight. The critical frames from the Arkansas video that were used to identify the bird as an Ivory-billed Woodpecker are shown to be equally, or more, compatible with the Pileated Woodpecker.…The identification of the bird filmed in Arkansas in April 2004 as an Ivory-billed Woodpecker is best regarded as unsafe. The similarities between the Arkansas bird and known Pileated Woodpeckers suggest that it was most likely a Pileated Woodpecker.
Doubt was also cast on some of the auditory evidence (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Recording_Unit" title="Autonomous Recording Unit" class="mw-redirect">ARU</a> recordings of double-raps) for the presence of Ivory-billed Woodpeckers in Arkansas and Florida. One group of researchers stated:<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>
All ARU double raps suggesting the presence of an Ivory-billed Woodpecker should be reconsidered in light of the phenomenon of duck wingtip collisions, especially those recorded in the winter months, when duck flocks are common across flooded bottomlands of the southeastern United States.
Cornell-organized searches in Arkansas and elsewhere from 2005 to 2008 did not produce any definitive evidence of the species. The press release summarizing the 2005–6 search season stated:<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup>
There were teasing glimpses and tantalizing sounds, but the 2005–2006 search for the Ivory-billed Woodpecker in Arkansas has concluded without the definitive visual documentation being sought. The search, led by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, with support from Audubon Arkansas, stretched from November through April when ivory-bill activity would be highest and a lack of leaf-cover permitted clear views through the dense forest.… “The search teams were very skilled, not only technically but in the execution of the search,” said Dr. John Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. “Even though we didn’t get additional definitive evidence of the ivory-bill in Arkansas, we’re not discouraged. The vastness of the forest combined with the highly mobile nature of the bird warrant additional searching.”
In May 2006, it was announced that a large search effort led by the Cornell team had been suspended for the season with only a handful of unconfirmed, fleeting sightings to report. At that point, conservation officers allowed the public back into areas of the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge that had been restricted upon the initial reported sightings.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> The 2006-07 search season had similar results to those of the previous year: <sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Lab and its partners concluded the 2006–07 field season in Arkansas at the end of April with no additional definitive evidence of ivory-bills to complement the data gathered in 2004 and 2005. But [Ronald] Rohrbaugh and others are convinced the research should continue, not only in Arkansas, but in other states that are part of the bird’s historic range. “We’ll return to Arkansas for at least another field season,” says Rohrbaugh. “Searches there and searches conducted by other agencies throughout the Southeast are still turning up reports of sounds that cannot be explained away. However, there’s no way to know for sure yet if reported double knocks and kent-like sounds were made by an ivory-bill or something else.”
Likewise, the 2007-08 search season did not deliver conclusive evidence of the bird:<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup>
The search teams covered lots of ground and tried new survey techniques…. Searchers documented more possible sightings and possible ivory-bill double knocks heard, but the definitive photograph, like the bird itself, remained elusive.
Cornell University did not field a search team in Arkansas during 2008–2009, but focused on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove" title="Mangrove">mangrove</a> habitats in southwest Florida, with a later visit planned for South Carolina. According to a Cornell University press release from January 2009, the 2008–09 season will be the last Cornell-sponsored search, absent confirmation of the bird:<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup>
There will be a distinctly different flavor to this season’s search for the Ivory-billed Woodpecker. Seven members of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s mobile search team will plunge into some of the most forbidding wilderness in southwestern Florida. …The work begins in Florida in early January and continues through mid-March. …In mid-March the Cornell Lab of Ornithology team will join the South Carolina search along the Congaree, PeeDee, and Santee Rivers.
“The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service-funded Ivory-billed Woodpecker searches will continue through the 2008-09 search season,” says Laurie Fenwood, Ivory-billed Woodpecker Recovery Team Coordinator for the U.S, Fish and Wildlife Service.…If no birds are confirmed, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology will not send an organized team into the field next year. “We remain committed to our original goal of striving to locate breeding pairs,” says Cornell Lab of Ornithology director John Fitzpatrick. “We will continue to accept and investigate credible reports of Ivory-billed Woodpeckers, and to promote protection and restoration of the old growth conditions upon which this magnificent species depended across the entire southeastern United States.”
The 2008–09 search effort in southwest Florida found no evidence of the bird:<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup>
We have found no signs of Ivory-billed Woodpeckers. No sightings, double knocks or calls, no replies to our many double-knock imitations. We have seen a few cavities of the appropriate size and shape for ivory-bills, but these can be old, or exceptionally large Pileated Woodpecker cavities, or mammal-enlarged Pileated Woodpecker cavities.… Given the results, it is unlikely a population of any meaningful size of Ivory-billed Woodpeckers exists in south Florida.
In October 2009, Cornell scientists announced that their search for the Ivory-billed Woodpecker in North America was being suspended.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> As of February 2010, the Cornell researchers concluded there was no hope of saving the bird, if it still exists:<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup>
But after five years of fruitless searching, hopes of saving the species have faded. "We don't believe a recoverable population of ivory-billed woodpeckers exists," says Ron Rohrbaugh, a conservation biologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who headed the original search team.
In September 2006, new claims that the Ivory-billed Woodpecker may not be extinct were released by a research group consisting of members from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_University" title="Auburn University">Auburn University</a> in Alabama and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Windsor" title="University of Windsor">University of Windsor</a> in Ontario. Dr. <a href="/w/index.php?title=Geoffrey_E._Hill&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Geoffrey E. Hill (page does not exist)">Geoffrey E. Hill</a> of Auburn University and Dr. Daniel Mennill of the University of Windsor have revealed a collection of evidence that the birds may still exist in the cypress swamps of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_panhandle" title="Florida panhandle" class="mw-redirect">Florida panhandle</a>. Their evidence includes 14 sightings of the birds and 300 recordings of sounds that can be attributed to the Ivory-billed Woodpecker, but also includes tell-tale foraging signs and appropriately sized tree nest cavities (Hill <i>et al.</i>, 2006). This evidence remains inconclusive as it excludes the photographic or DNA evidence that many experts cite as necessary before the presence of the species can be confirmed. While Dr. Hill and Dr. Mennill are themselves convinced of the bird's existence in Florida, they are quick to acknowledge that they have not yet conclusively proven the species' existence. The research team is currently undertaking a more complete survey of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choctawhatchee_River" title="Choctawhatchee River">Choctawhatchee River</a>, in hopes of obtaining photographic evidence of the bird's existence.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> In March 2007 the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Ornithological_Society" title="Florida Ornithological Society">Florida Ornithological Society</a> Records Committee voted unanimously <b>not</b> to accept the 2005-06 reports of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker on the Choctawhatchee River:<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup>
RC 06-610. Ivory-billed Woodpecker, <i>Campephilus principalis.</i> 21 May 2005 – 26 April 2006. Choctawhatchee River, Washington/Bay/Walton cos. A population of unknown size has been reported by a team from Auburn University from the lower Choctawhatchee River. There have been a few sightings but no photographs, some interesting recordings of “kent” calls and of double rap drums, and photographs taken of cavities and bark scaling. These observations were made on the heels of the much-publicized “rediscovery” of the species in Arkansas (Fitzpatrick et al. 2005). The species had not been documented to occur since 1944. The video documentation of the bird(s) from Arkansas, however, has been debated by many, although the record was accepted by the Arkansas Bird Records Committee. Our Committee felt that given the controversy of the Arkansas evidence, the species is best considered still extinct. Therefore only evidence that undoubtedly showed a living bird would be considered sufficient to accept a report.
The last specimen taken in Florida was in 1925; there have been numerous sight reports of varying credibility since, and one record of a feather found in a nest cavity in 1968 that was identified as an Ivory-billed Woodpecker inner secondary by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Wetmore" title="Alexander Wetmore">Alexander Wetmore</a>.
VOTE: NOT ACCEPT (0-7)

<i>(12 June 2008)</i> We completed our 2008 effort to get definitive evidence for ivorybills in the Choctawhatchee River Basin in early May…. Team members had no sightings of ivorybills and only two sound detections in 2008.… So where does all this leave us? Pretty much in the same position as in June 2006. We have a large body of evidence that Ivory-billed Woodpeckers persist along the Choctawhatchee River in the Florida panhandle, but we do not have definitive proof that they exist. Either the excitement of the ivorybill hunt causes competent birders to see and hear things that do not exist and leads competent sound analysts to misidentify hundreds of recorded sounds, or the few ivorybills in the Choctawhatchee River Basin are among the most elusive birds on the planet.
<i>(9 February 2009)</i> There has been little to report, and my students and I [Geoff Hill] have been enjoying the calm. We continue to work to get definitive documentation of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker in the Choctawhatchee River Basin.… To my knowledge, there have been no sightings of Ivory-billed Woodpeckers in the Choctawhatchee region since last spring. There were a few double knock detections in January, but not by my paid crew, Brian [Rolek], or me.
<i>(2 August 2009)</i> I haven’t posted many updates on this site in the past 9 months because there hasn’t not  [<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic" title="Sic">sic</a></i>] been much to report.… Since the winter of 2008, we have had few sightings or sound detections by anyone—none by Brian or me—and none that I would rate very highly.… In short, our experience over the past year indicates that ivorybills have moved out of the areas where we encountered them from 2005 to 2008.… There is no way to know whether the birds are in different areas in the Choctawhatchee Basin, different forests in the region, or dead.…I won’t post any more updates on this site.

In economically struggling east Arkansas, the speculation of a possible return of the Ivory-bill has served as a great source of economic exploitation, with tourist spending up 30%, primarily in and around the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinkley,_Arkansas" title="Brinkley, Arkansas">Brinkley, Arkansas</a>. A woodpecker "festival", a woodpecker hairstyle (a sort of mohawk with red, white, and black dye), and an "Ivory-bill Burger" have been featured locally. The lack of confirmed proof of the bird's existence, and the extremely small chance of actually seeing the bird even if it does exist (especially since the exact locations of the reported sightings are still guarded), have prevented the explosion in tourism some locals had anticipated.
Brinkley hosted "The Call of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker Celebration" in February 2006. The celebration included exhibits, birding tours, educational presentations, a vendor market, and more.
