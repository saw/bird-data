The <b>Great Potoo</b> (<i>Nyctibius grandis</i>) is a bird, both the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potoo" title="Potoo">potoo</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> and the largest member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)" title="Order (biology)">order</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprimulgiformes" title="Caprimulgiformes">Caprimulgiformes</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightjar" title="Nightjar">nightjars</a> and allies). It occurs in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical" title="Tropical" class="mw-redirect">tropical</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">America</a>.
Though related to the nightjars, like other potoos it lacks the bristles around the mouth found in the true nightjars (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprimulgidae" title="Caprimulgidae" class="mw-redirect">Caprimulgidae</a>). The Great Potoo is larger than a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow" title="Crow">crow</a> at 48â€“60&nbsp;cm (19-24&nbsp;inches) long and 360-650&nbsp;grams (12.7 oz-1.4&nbsp;lb). Wingspan in these bird is typically around 70 to 80.4 cm (28 to 31.7 in), though larger specimens can attain 100&nbsp;cm (39&nbsp;in).<sup id="cite_ref-Haverschmidt_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haverschmidt-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 34.2 to 40 cm (13.5 to 16 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail" title="Tail">tail</a> is 22 to 29.5 cm (8.7 to 11.6 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 1.6 to 2.2 cm (0.63 to 0.87 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 2.6 to 3.7 cm (1.0 to 1.5 in).<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potoo" title="Potoo">potoo</a>'s size is distinctive when it is seen. It is pale greyish to brown, finely patterned with black and buff. It has large orange eyes. The overall appearance is pale and grayish. The underside is barred and vermiculated, including the buffy chest. The tail is barred with sharply defined black borders, while the head and back are mottled with gray and buff. Like most members of their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)" title="Order (biology)">order</a>, the Great Potoo has plumage that is well-suited for camouflage.
The song is described as deep, guttural, strangled cries like <i>borrrrrr</i> or <i>oorrroo</i> repeated after a consistent interval of 10 to 20 seconds. The most common call is a loud, startling bark, <i>BWOW!</i> or <i>GWOK!</i> This call is usually made while the bird is disturbed.
It ranges from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> through northeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> and through most of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> down through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> as far as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and southeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>.
The Great Potoo is found mostly in dense lowland forest, forest edges and clearings. It may also range into foothills (up to about 1,500 m elevation), second-growth, open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland" title="Woodland">woodlands</a> (including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation" title="Plantation">plantations</a>) and is sometimes seen around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadow" title="Meadow">meadows</a>, but they always require trees-etc., for their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage" title="Camouflage">camouflaged</a> imitative perch.
This nocturnal predator is usually seen perched high above the ground while forgaging, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallying_out" title="Sallying out" class="mw-redirect">sallying out</a> when prey is spotted. After the pounce, the potoo almost always returns to its previous perch. The prey consists mostly of large flying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, especially large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle" title="Beetle">beetles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katydid" title="Katydid" class="mw-redirect">katydids</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthoptera" title="Orthoptera">Orthoptera</a> (including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket" title="Cricket">crickets</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper" title="Grasshopper">grasshoppers</a>). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat" title="Bat">Bats</a> are also taken. This species uses the sit and wait method where it will sit on an exposed perch waiting for a prey item to fly by then will dart out and return to the branch with it. Very often birds of this species will use the same hunting perch nightly.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Normally, during the day it perches upright on a tree stump, and is overlooked because it resembles part of the stump; this is a camouflage, not just by coloration, but a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage" title="Camouflage">camouflage</a> by the setting. The Great Potoo can be located at night by the reflection of light from its eyes as it sits vertical on a post, roost, or angled-tree trunk.
Breeding has been recorded as typically February to August, but depending on the portion of this bird's range breeding birds can be met with almost year-round.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The nest is a slight depression on a thick tree branch,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> at least 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) above ground, with a single white (slightly spotted) egg measuring about 5.2 x 3.8&nbsp;cm (2 x 1.8&nbsp;inches). Few details are known of the brooding behavior, but about a month elapses before the offspring is seen alone at the nest. A chick of a few days old weighed 220&nbsp;g (7.8&nbsp;oz).<sup id="cite_ref-Haverschmidt_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haverschmidt-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> After about 5 weeks the nestling is a two-thirds version of the adult, but with a lighter build, paler plumage, shorter tail, and smaller bill with less rectal bristles. The fledging period must be at least 2 months. After this time span, the offspring do not return to the nest site.<sup id="cite_ref-Haverschmidt_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haverschmidt-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Although the adult potoo likely has few natural predators, predation of eggs, nestlings and fledging is apparently not uncommon. Adults stay near the nest throughout the day and rely upon camoflauge to protect their offspring. Predators of Great Potoo nests in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a> have included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey" title="Monkey">monkeys</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantled_Howler" title="Mantled Howler" class="mw-redirect">Mantled Howlers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffroy%27s_spider_monkey" title="Geoffroy's spider monkey">Geoffroy's spider monkeys</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-headed_Capuchin" title="White-headed Capuchin" class="mw-redirect">White-headed Capuchins</a> as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayra" title="Tayra">Tayras</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collared_Forest_Falcon" title="Collared Forest Falcon">Collared Forest Falcons</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Great Potoo is normally described as "uncommon", but occurs frequently in areas of less disturbed forests and is often found to be rare along the edges of its range. The clearing of forest is the only conservation threat known to this bird. Due to its large range, it is considered a Species of Least Concern by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>.
