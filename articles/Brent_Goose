The <b>Brant</b> or <b>Brent Goose</b> (<i>Branta bernicla</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose" title="Goose">goose</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branta" title="Branta">Branta</a></i>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Brant" title="Black Brant">Black Brant</a> is an American subspecies. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature" title="Binomial nomenclature">specific descriptor</a> <i>bernicla</i> is from the same source as "barnacle" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle_Goose" title="Barnacle Goose">Barnacle Goose</a>, which looks similar but is not a close relation.
The Brant Goose is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose" title="Goose">goose</a> long and with a short, stubby bill. It measures 55–66 cm (22–26 in) long, 106–121 cm (42–48 in) across the wings and weighs 0.88–2.2 kg (1.9–4.9 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CRC_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The under-tail is pure white, and the tail black and very short (the shortest of any goose).
The species is divided three subspecies:
Some DNA evidence suggests that these forms are genetically distinct; while a split into three separate species has been proposed, it is not widely accepted, with other evidence upholding their maintenance as a single species.
The body of the dark-bellied form is fairly uniformly dark grey-brown all over, the flanks and belly not significantly paler than the back. The head and neck are black, with a small white patch on either side of the neck. It breeds on the Arctic coasts of central and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a> and winters in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, with over half the population in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, the rest between northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>.
The Pale-bellied Brant Goose appears blackish-brown and light grey in colour. The body is different shades of grey-brown all over, the flanks and belly are significantly paler than the back and present a marked contrast. The head and neck are black, with a small white patch on either side of the neck. It breeds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Josef_Land" title="Franz Josef Land">Franz Josef Land</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard" title="Svalbard">Svalbard</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> and northeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, wintering in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, northeast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_(ocean)" title="Atlantic (ocean)" class="mw-redirect">Atlantic</a> coast of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">U.S.</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine" title="Maine">Maine</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a>.
The Black Brant appears blackish-brown and white in colour. This form is a very contrastingly black and white bird, with a uniformly dark sooty-brown back, similarly-coloured underparts (with the dark colour extending furthest back of the three forms) and a prominent white flank patch; it also has larger white neck patches, forming a near-complete collar. It breeds in northwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> and eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>, and wintering mostly on the west coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, but also some in east <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>.
The Asian populations of the Black Brant populations had previous been regarded as a separate subspecies <i>orientalis</i> based on purported paler upperparts coloration; however, it is generally now believed that this is not correct.
A fourth form (known variously as <b>Gray Brant</b>, <b>Intermediate Brant</b> or <b>Grey-bellied Brant Goose</b>) has been proposed, although no formal subspecies description has been made as yet, for a population of birds breeding in central Arctic Canada (mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melville_Island_(Northwest_Territories_and_Nunavut)" title="Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)">Melville Island</a>), and wintering in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound" title="Puget Sound">Puget Sound</a> on the American west coast around the U.S./Canada border. These birds are intermediate in appearance between Black Brant and Pale-bellied Brant, having brown upperparts and grey underparts which give less of a contrast with the white flank patch. Given that this population exhibits mixed characters, it has also been proposed that, rather than being a separate subspecies, it is actually a result of interbreeding between these two forms.
It used to be a strictly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast" title="Coast">coastal</a> bird in winter, seldom leaving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide" title="Tide">tidal</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuaries</a>, where it feeds on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zostera" title="Zostera">eel-grass</a> (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zostera_marina" title="Zostera marina">Zostera marina</a></i>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed" title="Seaweed">seaweed</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lettuce" title="Sea lettuce">sea lettuce</a> (<i>Ulva</i>). In recent decades, it has started using agricultural land a short distance inland, feeding extensively on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass" title="Grass">grass</a> and winter-sown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal" title="Cereal">cereals</a>. This may be behaviour learnt by following other species of geese. Food resource pressure may also be important in forcing this change, as the world population has risen over tenfold to 400,000-500,000 by the mid 1980s, possibly reaching the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity" title="Carrying capacity">carrying capacity</a> of the estuaries. In the breeding season, it uses low-lying wet coastal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a> for both breeding and feeding. The nest is bowl-shaped, lined with grass and down, in an elevated location, often in a small pond.
The Brant Goose is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEWA" title="AEWA" class="mw-redirect">AEWA</a>) applies.
