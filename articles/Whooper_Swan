The <b>Whooper Swan</b> (pronounced <i>hooper</i>), <i>Cygnus cygnus</i>, is a large Northern Hemisphere <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan" title="Swan">swan</a>. It is the Eurasian counterpart of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpeter_Swan" title="Trumpeter Swan">Trumpeter Swan</a>. An old name for the Whooper Swan is 'Elk'; it is so called in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Willughby" title="Francis Willughby">Francis Willughby</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ray" title="John Ray">John Ray</a>'s <i>Ornithology</i> of 1676.
The Whooper Swan is similar in appearance to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bewick%27s_Swan" title="Bewick's Swan" class="mw-redirect">Bewick's Swan</a>. However, it is larger, at a length of 140–165 cm (55–65 in) and a wingspan of 205–275 cm (81–108 in). Weight typically is in the range of 7.4–14 kg (16–31 lb), with an average of 9.8–11.4 kg (22–25 lb) for males and 8.2–9.2 kg (18–20 lb) for females. The verified record mass was 15.5&nbsp;kg (34&nbsp;lb) for a wintering male from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>. It is considered to be amongst the heaviest flying birds.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CRC_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 56.2–63.5 cm (22.1–25.0 in), the tarsus is 10.4–13 cm (4.1–5.1 in) and the bill is 9.2–11.6 cm (3.6–4.6 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Madge_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> It has a more angular head shape and a more variable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> pattern that always shows more yellow than black (Bewick's Swans have more black than yellow).
Whooper swans require large areas of water to live in, especially when they are still growing, because their body weight cannot be supported by their legs for extended periods of time. The whooper swan spends much of its time swimming, straining the water for food, or eating plants that grow on the bottom.<sup id="cite_ref-Mondadori_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mondadori-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Whooper swans have a deep honking call and, despite their size, are powerful fliers. Whooper swans can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> many hundreds of miles to their wintering sites in northern Europe and eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. They breed in subarctic Eurasia, further south than Bewicks in the taiga zone. They are rare breeders in northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, particularly in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkney" title="Orkney">Orkney</a>, and no more than five pairs have bred there in recent years. This bird is an occasional vagrant to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Icelandic</a> breeders overwinter in the United Kingdom and Ireland, especially in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfowl" title="Wildfowl" class="mw-redirect">wildfowl</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_reserve" title="Nature reserve">nature reserves</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_for_the_Protection_of_Birds" title="Royal Society for the Protection of Birds">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a> and of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfowl_and_Wetlands_Trust" title="Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust" class="mw-redirect">Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust</a>.
Whooper swans pair for life, and their cygnets stay with them all winter; they are sometimes joined by offspring from previous years. Their preferred breeding habitat is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland" title="Wetland">wetland</a>, but semi-domesticated birds will build a nest anywhere close to water. Both the male and female help build the nest, and the male will stand guard over the nest while the female incubates. The female will usually lay 4-7 eggs (exceptionally 12). The cygnets hatch after about 36 days and have a grey or brown plumage. The cygnets can fly at an age of 120 to 150 days.
Whooper Swans are much admired in Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-Mondadori_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mondadori-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The Whooper Swan is the national bird of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a> and is featured on the Finnish 1 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro" title="Euro">euro</a> coin. The Whooper Swan is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEWA" title="AEWA" class="mw-redirect">AEWA</a>) applies.
