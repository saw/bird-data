The Red-lored Amazon is 32–35&nbsp;cm (13&nbsp;in) in length, with a weight of 310–480 g. The plumage is primarily green, with a red forehead and, in some subspecies, yellow cheeks (sometimes with red spots). The crown is blue. Adult males and females do not differ in plumage. Juveniles have less yellow on the cheeks, less red on the forehead, and dark irises.

Their food includes fruits,<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> nuts and seeds. Like all parrots, Red Lored Amazons need a varied diet consisting of high quality pellets, a quality seed mix, and daily servings of fresh, bird-safe fruits and vegetables.
The Red-lored Amazon nests in tree cavities. The eggs are white and there are usually three or four in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for about 26 days and the chicks leave the nest about 60 days after hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-DA_2003_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DA_2003-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
In some areas, notably parts of Mexico and Venezuela, the Red-lored Amazon has become rare through trapping for the cagebird trade. On the other hand, it seems to be able to adapt to human-altered habitat to a considerable degree.<sup id="cite_ref-herreraetal2006_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-herreraetal2006-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Red-lored Amazons are fairly common pet parrots in the Americas. They can be devoted pets and some make fairly good talkers. Like most Amazon parrots they often have a tendency to vocalize loudly, and sometimes to bite. Their behavior ranges from being quiet and curious to being aggressive, this can all be changed by basic training when the bird is of young age.
