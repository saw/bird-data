<i>Podiceps griseigena</i> (<i>Lapsus</i>)
The <b>Red-necked Grebe</b> (<i>Podiceps grisegena</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_bird" title="Aquatic bird" class="mw-redirect">aquatic bird</a> found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_zone#GROUP_C:_Temperate.2Fmesothermal_climates" title="Climate zone" class="mw-redirect">temperate regions</a> of the northern hemisphere. Its wintering habitat is largely restricted to calm waters just beyond the waves around ocean coasts, although some birds may winter on large lakes. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grebe" title="Grebe">Grebes</a> prefer shallow bodies of fresh water such as lakes, marshes or fish-ponds as breeding sites.
The Red-necked Grebe is a nondescript dusky-grey bird in winter. During the breeding season, it acquires the distinctive red neck plumage, black cap and contrasting pale grey face from which its name was derived. It also has an elaborate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship#Courtship_in_the_animal_kingdom" title="Courtship">courtship</a> display and a variety of loud mating calls. Once paired, it builds a nest from water plants on top of floating vegetation in a shallow lake or bog.
Like all grebes, the Red-necked is a good swimmer, a particularly swift diver, and responds to danger by diving rather than flying. The feet are positioned far back on the body, near the tail, which makes the bird ungainly on land. It dives for fish or picks insects off vegetation; it also swallows its own feathers, possibly to protect the digestive system. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_status" title="Conservation status">conservation status</a> of its two subspecies—<i>P. g. grisegena</i> found in Europe and western Asia, and the larger <i>P. g. holboelii</i> in North America and eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>—is evaluated as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern" title="Least Concern">Least Concern</a>, and the global population is stable or growing.
Grebes are small to medium-large water birds with lobed, rather than webbed, toes. There are several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genera</a>, of which the most widespread is <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podiceps" title="Podiceps">Podiceps</a></i> with nine species, one recently extinct.

This is one of the most vocal grebes during the breeding season, but, like its relatives, it is mainly silent for the rest of the year. It has a loud, wailing or howling display call <i>uooooh</i>, given by a single bird or a pair in duet, by night or during the day, and often from cover. Long sequences of up to 60&nbsp;consecutive notes may be delivered during singing encounters between rival territorial birds. A great variety of quacking, clucking, hissing, rattling and purring calls are also given, with much individual variation.<sup id="cite_ref-snow20_10-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-snow20-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Breeding takes place in shallow freshwater lakes, bays of larger lakes, marshes, and other inland bodies of water, often less than 3&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare" title="Hectare">ha</a> (6&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre" title="Acre">acres</a>) in extent and less than 2&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;ft) deep. The Red-necked Grebe shows a preference for waters in forested areas or, further north, in shrub <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a>, and favours sites with abundant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_plant" title="Emergent plant">emergent vegetation</a>, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_bed" title="Reed bed">reedbeds</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-BirdLife_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdLife-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> The best breeding habitat is fish-ponds, which have an abundance of food in addition to meeting the other requirements.<sup id="cite_ref-Kloskowski_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kloskowski-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> The American subspecies is less tied to a high aquatic plant density, and sometimes breeds on quite open lakes.<sup id="cite_ref-Johnsgard2_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Johnsgard2-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>

The breeding range of the Red-necked Grebe overlaps with that of the Slavonian Grebe, although the latter species tends to be displaced from sites suited to both. The Red-necked Grebe prefers an inland temperate climate, and is less successful near coasts and in subarctic and warm temperate zones. It is usually a lowland bird, breeding below 100&nbsp;m (330&nbsp;ft), although has nested at up to 1800&nbsp;m (5,900&nbsp;ft) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-snow20_10-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-snow20-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>

Like all grebes, the Red-necked Grebe nests near water into which it can escape, since the position of the legs far back on the body prevents fast movement on land.

Eggs may be destroyed and chicks killed by a range of predators, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon" title="Raccoon">raccoon</a> in North America and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion_Crow" title="Carrion Crow">Carrion Crow</a> in Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-Johnsgard2_3-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Johnsgard2-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-usfws_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-usfws-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esox" title="Esox">Pike</a> may take swimming chicks.<sup id="cite_ref-Chamberlin_34-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Chamberlin-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> On average, for each adult, 0.65 young birds are still alive by their fourth month, although the mortality rate for the adult is unknown. Red-necked Grebes attempt to evade <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">birds of prey</a> by diving; when feeding, dives average less than 30&nbsp;seconds, although escape dives are more prolonged.<sup id="cite_ref-Johnsgard2_3-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Johnsgard2-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
On the breeding grounds, the Red-necked Grebe feeds mainly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> including adult and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva" title="Larva">larval</a> aquatic insects, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_beetle" title="Water beetle">water beetles</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly" title="Dragonfly">dragonfly</a> larvae, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayfish" title="Crayfish">crayfish</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusc" title="Mollusc" class="mw-redirect">molluscs</a>. Fish (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelt_(fish)" title="Smelt (fish)">smelt</a><sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup>) may be important locally or seasonally, especially for the American subspecies, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a> can constitute up to 20% of the grebe's diet.

Aquatic prey is obtained by diving or by swimming on surface with the head submerged, and terrestrial insects and their larvae are picked off vegetation.<sup id="cite_ref-snow20_10-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-snow20-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> A line slanting downward from the eye to the tip of the opened lower mandible may be used for sighting on prey before diving or when swimming under water.

Like other grebes, the Red-necked Grebe ingests large quantities of its own feathers, which remain in the bird's stomach.<sup id="cite_ref-cornell_12-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cornell-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Feathers are not only swallowed by adults, mainly during self-preening, but are often fed to the young, sometimes within a day of hatching.
