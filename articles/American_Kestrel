The <b>American Kestrel</b> (<i>Falco sparverius</i>), sometimes colloquially known as the <i>Sparrow Hawk</i>, is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon" title="Falcon">falcon</a>, and the only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kestrel" title="Kestrel">kestrel</a> found in the Americas. It is the most common falcon in North America, and is found in a wide variety of habitats. At 19–21 centimeters (7–8 in) long, it is also the smallest falcon in North America. It exhibits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in size and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a>, although both sexes have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufous" title="Rufous">rufous</a> back with noticeable barring. Juveniles are similar in plumage to adults.
The American Kestrel hunts by hovering in the air with rapid wing beats or perching and scanning the ground for prey. Its diet typically consists of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper" title="Grasshopper">grasshoppers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard" title="Lizard">lizards</a>, mice, and other small birds. It nests in cavities in trees, cliffs, buildings, and other structures. The female lays three to seven eggs, which both sexes help to incubate. It is a common bird to be used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry" title="Falconry">falconry</a>, especially by beginners.
Its breeding range extends from central and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> across northern Canada to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, and south throughout North America, into central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. It is a local breeder in Central America and is widely distributed throughout South America. Most birds breeding in Canada and the northern United States <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> south in the winter. It is an occasional vagrant to western Europe.
The American Kestrel is the smallest falcon in North America and, under traditional classification, is the smallest raptor in America.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The American Kestrel is sexually dimorphic, although there is some overlap in plumage coloration between the sexes. The bird ranges from 12 to 27 cm (4.7 to 11 in) in length with a wingspan of 50–61 cm (20–24 in). The female kestrel is larger than the male. The male weighs 80–105 g (2.8–3.7 oz), as opposed to the female which weighs 100–120 grams (3.5–4.2 oz). In standard measurements, the wing bone is 16–21 cm (6.3–8.3 in) long, the tail is 11–15 cm (4.3–5.9 in) and the tarsus is 3.2–4 cm (1.3–1.6 in).<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
In contrast to many other raptor species, the sexes differ more in plumage than in size. Males have blue-grey <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing" title="Wing">wings</a> with black spots and white undersides with black barring. The back is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufous" title="Rufous">rufous</a>, with barring on the lower half. The belly and flanks are white with black spotting. The tail is also rufous, with a white or rufous tip and a black subterminal band.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The back and wings of the female American Kestrel are rufous with dark brown barring. The undersides of the females are creamy to buff with heavy brown streaking. The tail is noticeably different from the male's, being rufous in color with numerous narrow dark black bars. Juveniles exhibit coloration patterns similar to the adults'.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> In both sexes, the head is white with a bluish-grey top. There are also two narrow, vertical black facial markings on each side of the head, while other falcons have one.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Two black spots (ocelli) can be found on each side of the white or orangish nape.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The function of these spots is debated, but the most commonly accepted theory is that they act as "false eyes", and help to protect the bird from potential attackers.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> The wings are moderately long, fairly narrow, and taper to a point. While the kestrel is perched, the wingtips are noticeably shorter than the tail tip.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from November 2011">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
The American Kestrel has four basic vocalizations – the "klee" or "killy", the "whine", and the "chitter."<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The "klee" is usually delivered as a rapid series – <i>klee, klee, klee, klee</i> when the kestrel is upset or excited. This call is used in a wide variety of situations and is heard from both sexes, but the larger females typically have lower-pitched voices than the males. The "whine" call is primarily associated with feeding, but is also uttered during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copulation" title="Copulation" class="mw-redirect">copulation</a>. The "chitter" is used in activities which involve interaction between male and female birds, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship_feeding" title="Courtship feeding" class="mw-redirect">courtship feeding</a>, copulation, and the feeding of nestlings.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Nestlings can produce calls similar to those of adults at 16 days old.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
Until the sixth edition of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOU_Checklist_of_North_American_Birds" title="AOU Checklist of North American Birds">AOU Checklist of North American Birds</a> was published by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> in 1983, the most commonly used name for the American Kestrel was the <i>Sparrow Hawk</i> or <i>Sparrowhawk</i>. This was due to a mistaken connection with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Sparrowhawk" title="Eurasian Sparrowhawk">Eurasian Sparrowhawk</a> in the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter" title="Accipiter">Accipiter</a></i>. The sixth edition of the AOU Checklist corrected this, officially renaming the bird <i>American Kestrel</i>. Several other colloquial names for the kestrel are also in use, including <i>Grasshopper Hawk</i>, due to its diet, and <i>Killy Hawk</i>, due to its distinct call.<sup id="cite_ref-Wauer4_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wauer4-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
The American Kestrel's scientific name, <i>Falco sparverius</i>, was given by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolus_Linnaeus" title="Carolus Linnaeus" class="mw-redirect">Carolus Linnaeus</a> in his 18th century work <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae" title="Systema Naturae">Systema Naturae</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> The genus refers to the falcate, or hooked, shape of the beak, and the specific name means "pertaining to a sparrow", referring to the bird's small size and occasional hunting of sparrows.<sup id="cite_ref-Wauer4_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wauer4-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
Seventeen subspecies of the American Kestrel are recognized, generally based upon plumage, size, and vocalizations:<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
American Kestrels are found in a wide variety of habitats, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasslands" title="Grasslands" class="mw-redirect">grasslands</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadows" title="Meadows" class="mw-redirect">meadows</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserts" title="Deserts" class="mw-redirect">deserts</a>, and other open to semiopen regions. They can also be found in both urban and suburban areas. A kestrel's habitat must include perches, open space for hunting, and cavities for nesting (whether natural or man-made).<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> The American Kestrel is able to live in very diverse conditions, ranging from above the Arctic Circle,<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> to the tropics of Central America, to elevations of over 4,500 meters (14,764&nbsp;ft) in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes_Mountains" title="Andes Mountains" class="mw-redirect">Andes Mountains</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> The bird is distributed from northern Canada and Alaska to the southernmost tip of South America, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tierra_del_Fuego" title="Tierra del Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a>. It is the only kestrel found in the Americas.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_Intro_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA_Intro-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> It has occurred as a vagrant in the UK, Denmark, Malta and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores" title="Azores">Azores</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-BWP_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BWP-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup>
American Kestrels in Canada and the northern United States typically migrate south in the winter, sometimes going as far as Central America and the Caribbean. Birds that breed south of about 35 degrees north latitude are usually year-round residents. Migration also depends on local weather conditions.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> Wintering kestrels' choice of habitat varies by sex. Females are found in open areas more often than males during the non-breeding season. A common explanation for this behavior is that the larger females arrive at the preferred habitat first and exclude males from their territory.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup>
The American Kestrel is not long-lived, with a lifespan of &lt;5 years for wild birds.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_Demography_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA_Demography-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> The oldest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_banding" title="Bird banding" class="mw-redirect">banded</a> wild bird was 11 years and 7 months,<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> while captive kestrels can live up to 14–17 years.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_Demography_23-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA_Demography-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> In a study, humans accounted for 43.2% of 1,355 reported deaths, which included direct killing and roadkills, while predation (including by larger birds of prey) accounted for 2.8%. This statistic is likely biased, however, as reported deaths are usually found near or in areas populated by humans.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_Demography_23-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA_Demography-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>
American Kestrels feed largely on small animals such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper" title="Grasshopper">grasshoppers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly" title="Dragonfly">dragonflies</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard" title="Lizard">lizards</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse" title="Mouse">mice</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vole" title="Vole">voles</a>. They will occasionally eat other small birds. The kestrel has also been reported to have killed larger animals such as snakes, bats, and squirrels.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> The kestrel maintains high population densities, in part because of the broad scope of its diet. The American Kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_power_lines" title="Overhead power lines" class="mw-redirect">overhead power lines</a>, or fence posts. It also hunts by hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects in the air.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup>
Prey is almost always caught on the ground. Before striking, the kestrel characteristically bobs its head and tail, then makes a direct flight toward the prey to grab it in its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw#Birds" title="Claw">talons</a>. During the breeding season, the bird will carry large prey back to its mate or young. One study found that an American Kestrel pair "foraged in ways that minimized the costs of energy acquisition in its particular situation". For example, if the success rate for catching prey decreases significantly in a particular area, the bird will move to a different area.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup>
American Kestrels are sexually mature by their first spring.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> In migratory populations, the males arrive at the breeding ground before females, then the female selects a mate. Pair bonds are strong, often permanent. Pairs usually use previous nesting sites in consecutive years. This gives birds an advantage over younger or invading individuals, as they would already be familiar with the hunting grounds, neighbors, predators, and other features of the site.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> Males perform elaborate dive displays to advertise their territory and attract a mate. These displays consist of several climbs and dives, with three or four "klee" calls at their peaks. Females are promiscuous for about one to two weeks after their arrival at the nesting site. This is thought to stimulate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation" title="Ovulation">ovulation</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> Food transfers from the male to the female occur from about four to five weeks prior to egg laying to one to two weeks after.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup>
American Kestrels are cavity nesters, but they are able to adapt to a wide variety of nesting situations. They generally prefer natural cavities (such as in trees) with closed tops and tight fitting entrances, as to provide for maximum protection of the eggs and young.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> Kestrels occasionally nest in holes created by large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpeckers</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> or use the abandoned nests of other birds, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Hawk" title="Red-tailed Hawk">Red-tailed Hawks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(bird)" title="Merlin (bird)">Merlins</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crows" title="Crows" class="mw-redirect">crows</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> They have been recorded nesting on cliff ledges and building tops, as well as in abandoned cavities in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus" title="Cactus">cactuses</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> American Kestrels also commonly utilize nesting boxes.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup>
Three to seven eggs (typically four or five) are laid approximately 24–72 hours apart. The average egg size is 32&nbsp;mm by 29&nbsp;mm, 10% larger than average for birds of its body size. The eggs are white to cream in color with brown or grey splotching. Incubation usually lasts 30 days and is mainly the responsibility of the female, although the male incubates 15–20% of the time. Eggs which are lost are typically replaced in 11–12 days. Hatching takes place over three to four days. Hatchlings are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" title="Altricial">altricial</a>, and are only able to sit up after five days. They grow very quickly, reaching an adult weight after 16–17 days. After 28–31 days, their wings develop and they are able to leave the nest.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup>
The American Kestrel is likely the most abundant falcon in North America, although its total population is difficult to quantify, as local populations can change quickly due to resource availability. Count data from the USGS <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeding_Bird_Survey" title="Breeding Bird Survey" class="mw-redirect">Breeding Bird Survey</a> (BBS) indicate that the North American breeding population is experiencing long-term and gradual but sustained declines, with some regions, such as New England and coastal California, exhibiting more rapid declines.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> Count data from raptor migration corridors also indicate regional population declines and largely corroborate BBS data.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> The North American population has been estimated at 1.2 million pairs, with the Central and South American populations being as large. A smaller estimate is 236,000 birds wintering in North America. A population increase occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries, probably due to deforestation for agriculture. The resulting pastures provided an ideal habitat for kestrels.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_Demography_23-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA_Demography-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>
The southeastern U.S. subspecies (<i>Falco sparverius paulus</i>) has declined 82% since 1940 due to a decrease in nest site availability. This decline is a result of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longleaf_Pines" title="Longleaf Pines" class="mw-redirect">Longleaf Pines</a> being cleared from agricultural fields.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> Despite this, the American Kestrel is classed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern" title="Least Concern">Least Concern</a> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
