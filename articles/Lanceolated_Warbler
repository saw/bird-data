This is a small warbler. The adult has a streaked brown back, whitish grey underparts, which have small lance-head like streaks, also found on the undertail. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous.
This is a skulky species which is very difficult to see except sometimes when singing. It creeps through grass and low foliage.
The song is a monotonous mechanical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insect</a>-like reeling as in other species in the group, often given at dusk.
