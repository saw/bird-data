The <b>Orange-breasted Falcon</b> (<i>Falco deiroleucus</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon" title="Falcon">falcon</a> family. It is probably closely related to and looks like a larger version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_Falcon" title="Bat Falcon">Bat Falcon</a>. These two, in turn, are probably closest to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplomado_Falcon" title="Aplomado Falcon">Aplomado Falcon</a> and constitute a rather old American lineage of <i>Falco</i>s.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
It is found from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>. It's a medium-sized falcon at 35–40&nbsp;cm (14–16&nbsp;in) long and a weight of 325-700 grams (11.5 oz.-1.5&nbsp;lbs).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> It is a bird <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator" class="mw-redirect">predator</a>, with strong <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talons" title="Talons" class="mw-redirect">talons</a> that enable it to catch prey in flight, and is considered by some - as the German-Brazilian ornithologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Sick" title="Helmut Sick">Helmut Sick</a> - as filling the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche" title="Ecological niche">ecological niche</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_Falcon" title="Peregrine Falcon">Peregrine Falcon</a> as a breeding species in tropical America. The Orange-breasted Falcon, however, seems to favor more heavily wooded habitats than the Peregrine, therefore the species does not seem to be in ecological competition with Peregrine Falcons wintering or breeding in South America. The Orange-breasted Falcon has a similar plumage to the much smaller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_Falcon" title="Bat Falcon">Bat Falcon</a> and is generally considered most closely related to that species now.
