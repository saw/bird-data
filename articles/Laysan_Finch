The <b>Laysan Finch</b> (<i>Telespiza cantans</i>) is a species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finch" title="Finch">finch</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_honeycreeper" title="Hawaiian honeycreeper">Hawaiian honeycreeper</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">subfamily</a>, Drepanidinae, that is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism" title="Endemism">endemic</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Hawaiian_Islands" title="Northwestern Hawaiian Islands">Northwestern Hawaiian Islands</a>. It is one of four remaining finch-billed Hawaiian honeycreepers, and is closely related to the smaller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihoa_Finch" title="Nihoa Finch">Nihoa Finch</a>. The Laysan Finch is named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laysan" title="Laysan">Laysan</a>, the island to which it was endemic on its discovery. It was subsequently introduced to a few other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoll" title="Atoll">atolls</a>, and its historical range included some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">main islands</a>.
The Laysan Finch is a large honeycreeper with a heavy bill. Overall the male has yellow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> with a whitish belly and a grey neck. The female is duller than the male, with brown streaking. It is almost impossible to confuse the Laysan Finch with any other bird in the field as it is the only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> species found on the few islands it lives on.
On its discovery the Laysan Finch was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism" title="Endemism">endemic</a> resident of the small island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laysan" title="Laysan">Laysan</a>, along with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laysan_Rail" title="Laysan Rail">Laysan Rail</a> (<i>Porzana palmeri</i>), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laysan_%CA%BBApapane" title="Laysan ʻApapane">Laysan <span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Apapane</a> (<i>Himatione sanguinea freethi</i>), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laysan_Duck" title="Laysan Duck">Laysan Duck</a> (<i>Anas laysanensis</i>), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laysan_Millerbird" title="Laysan Millerbird">Laysan Millerbird</a> (<i>Acrocephalus familiaris familiaris</i>). Populations were introduced to several islands, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_and_Hermes_Atoll" title="Pearl and Hermes Atoll">Pearl and Hermes Atoll</a>, where the species persists, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Atoll" title="Midway Atoll">Midway Atoll</a>, where it survived until the introduction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil" title="Fossil">fossil</a> record shows that the finch once had a greater range in Hawai<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i, reaching as far as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oahu" title="Oahu">O<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ahu</a>, and that birds on Laysan represent a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relict" title="Relict">relict</a> population.
The Laysan Finch nests in vegetation, laying three eggs in a cup-shaped nest. These are incubated for 16 days by the female, the male in turn feeding the female. The chicks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> after three weeks, and are cared for by the parents for another three weeks.
The Laysan Finch is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalist_and_specialist_species" title="Generalist and specialist species">generalist</a>, feeding on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a>, small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion" title="Carrion">carrion</a> (of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabirds</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Monk_Seal" title="Hawaiian Monk Seal" class="mw-redirect">Hawaiian Monk Seals</a>), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> of nesting seabirds. While unable to break into the eggs of the larger seabirds (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross" title="Albatross">albatross</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booby" title="Booby">boobies</a>) they will scavenge from them. They actively take the eggs of smaller seabirds such as those of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Tern" title="White Tern">White Tern</a> (<i>Gygis alba</i>) and the endemic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laysan_Duck" title="Laysan Duck">Laysan Duck</a> (<i>Anas laysanensis</i>).
The Laysan Finch is listed as Vulnerable by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a> because of its highly restricted range and vulnerability to extremes of weather,<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> and it is considered endangered by the State of Hawai<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i and U.S. government. It survived the devastating effects of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species" title="Introduced species">introduction</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_rabbit" title="Domestic rabbit">domestic rabbits</a> (unlike the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laysan_Millerbird" title="Laysan Millerbird">Laysan Millerbird</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laysan_%CA%BBApapane" title="Laysan ʻApapane"><span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Apapane</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laysan_Rail" title="Laysan Rail">rail</a>) by taking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion" title="Carrion">carrion</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>.
