The <b>Black Storm Petrel</b> (<i>Oceanodroma melania</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm-petrel" title="Storm-petrel" class="mw-redirect">storm-petrel</a> family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrobatidae" title="Hydrobatidae" class="mw-redirect">Hydrobatidae</a>. It is 23&nbsp;cm in length, with a wingspan of 46â€“51&nbsp;cm.
The species breeds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird_colony" title="Seabird colony" class="mw-redirect">colonially</a> on islands off the southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast" title="Coast">coast</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and off the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California_peninsula" title="Baja California peninsula">Baja Peninsula</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_California" title="Gulf of California">Gulf of California</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Nesting sites are usually in rock crevices, occasionally in small burrows in soft earth. It also uses unused burrows from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auklet" title="Auklet" class="mw-redirect">auklets</a>. Colonies are attended <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_animal" title="Nocturnal animal" class="mw-redirect">nocturnally</a> in order to avoid predatory birds such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gulls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_Falcon" title="Peregrine Falcon">Peregrine Falcons</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owls</a>. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the burrow. The female lays a single white egg per breeding season, if the egg is lost then it is replaced only rarely. Both parents share incubation duties, incubation lasting around 50 days. The chick is brooded for a few days after hatching until it is able to thermoregulate by itself, after which both parents forage to provide food. Chicks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> 10 weeks after hatching.
The Black Storm Petrel spends the rest of the year at sea, but occurring closer to shore than most other storm-petrels. Because of this, it sometimes can be seen from the mainland. It undertakes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migration</a> away from the waters surrounding its breeding colonies and, unusually, has two wintering grounds, one in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Current" title="California Current">California Current</a> off Central California and another further south off the coast of Central America as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>. It is thought to migrate in this fashion in order to avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane" title="Hurricane" class="mw-redirect">hurricanes</a> in its breeding grounds.
It feeds on mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton" title="Plankton">planktonic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>, with a preference of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva" title="Larva">larvae</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_lobster" title="Spiny lobster">spiny lobster</a>. It will also take small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offal" title="Offal">offal</a>. It feeds using several techniques, including plunge diving to 1 m bellow the water's surface from flight, feeding while swimming on the surface, and feeding while flying. At sea it usually forages singly.
The Black Storm Petrel is a common species, numbering several million pairs, and is not considered threatened. It has suffered losses on some of the breeding islands, particularly from feral <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats" title="Cats" class="mw-redirect">cats</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rats" title="Rats" class="mw-redirect">rats</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_restoration" title="Island restoration">Island restoration</a> projects have removed these predators from several of its nesting islands.
