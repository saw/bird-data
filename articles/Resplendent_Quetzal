The <b>Resplendent Quetzal</b> (<i>Pharomachrus mocinno</i>) is a bird in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trogon" title="Trogon">trogon</a> family. It is found from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a> (unlike the other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzal" title="Quetzal">quetzals</a> of the genus <i>Pharomachrus</i>, which are found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> and eastern Panama). It is well known for its colorful plumage. There are two subspecies, <i>P. m. mocinno</i> and <i>P. m. costaricensis</i>.
This quetzal plays an important role in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#Mythology_and_worldview" title="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerican mythologies</a>. The Resplendent Quetzal is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>'s national bird, and an image of it is on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Guatemala" title="Flag of Guatemala">flag</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Guatemala" title="Coat of arms of Guatemala">coat of arms of Guatemala</a>. It is also the name of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemalan_quetzal" title="Guatemalan quetzal">local currency</a> (abbreviation GTQ).
The Resplendent Quetzal was first described by Mexican naturalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_de_La_Llave" title="Pablo de La Llave">Pablo de La Llave</a> in 1832. It is one of five species of the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzal" title="Quetzal">Pharomachrus</a></i> known as quetzals. The term "quetzal" was originally used for just this species, but is now applied to all members of the genera <i>Pharomachrus</i> and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euptilotis" title="Euptilotis" class="mw-redirect">Euptilotis</a></i>.
Two subspecies are recognised, <i>P. m. mocinno</i> and <i>P. m. costaricensis</i>. The epithet <i>mocinno</i> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_de_la_Llave" title="Pablo de la Llave" class="mw-redirect">Llave</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinization_(literature)" title="Latinization (literature)" class="mw-redirect">Latinization</a> of the name of the biologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mariano_Moci%C3%B1o" title="José Mariano Mociño">J. M. Mociño</a>, a mentor of his. (It is sometimes spelled <i>mocino</i>, but "ñ" was formerly spelled "nn" in Spanish, so the spelling with "nn" is justified and in any case now official.<sup><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v076n01/p0108-p0108.html">[1]</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zoonomen.net/avtax/frame.html">[2]</a></sup>)
The word "quetzal" came from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuatl" title="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> (Aztec), where <i>quetzalli</i> (from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(linguistics)" title="Root (linguistics)">root</a> <i>quetz</i> = "stand") meant "tall upstanding plume" and then "quetzal tail feather"; from that Nahuatl <i>quetzaltotōtl</i> means "quetzal-feather bird" and thus "quetzal".<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species is 36–40 cm (14–16 in) long, plus up to 65&nbsp;cm (26&nbsp;in) of tail streamer for the male, and weighs about 210 g (7&nbsp;oz). It is the largest representative of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trogon" title="Trogon">trogon</a> order.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The subspecies <i>costaricensis</i> is slightly smaller than the nominate race and has shorter narrower tail plumes.
Resplendent Quetzals have a green body (showing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence" title="Iridescence">iridescence</a> from green-gold to blue-violet) and red breast. Their green upper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_covert" title="Wing covert" class="mw-redirect">tail coverts</a> hide their tails and in breeding males are particularly splendid, being longer than the rest of the body. The primary wing coverts are also unusually long and give a fringed appearance. The male has a helmet-like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(feathers)" title="Crest (feathers)">crest</a>. The bill, which is partly covered by green filamentous feathers, is yellow in mature males and black in females.
The skin of the quetzal is very thin and easily torn, so it has evolved thick plumage to protect its skin.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from May 2008">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Like other members of the trogon family, it has large eyes that adapt easily to the dim light of its forest home.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from May 2008">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
The "song" is a treble syllable described as <i>kyow</i> or like "a whimpering pup", often in pairs, which may be repeated monotonously. Resplendent Quetzals have other unmusical calls as well.
Their habitat is montane <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_forest" title="Cloud forest">cloud forests</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> (from Southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a>).
Resplendent Quetzals are weak fliers. Their known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator" class="mw-redirect">predators</a> include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornate_Hawk-Eagle" title="Ornate Hawk-Eagle">Ornate Hawk-Eagle</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owls</a> as adults, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Toucanet" title="Emerald Toucanet">Emerald Toucanets</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Jay" title="Brown Jay">Brown Jays</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-tailed_Weasel" title="Long-tailed Weasel" class="mw-redirect">Long-tailed Weasels</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel" title="Squirrel">squirrels</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinkajou" title="Kinkajou">Kinkajou</a> as nestlings or eggs.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Resplendent Quetzals are considered specialized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frugivore" title="Frugivore">fruit-eaters</a>, although they mix their diet with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> (notably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasp" title="Wasp">wasps</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ants</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva" title="Larva">larvae</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard" title="Lizard">lizards</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-dayer_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dayer-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Particularly important are wild <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado" title="Avocado">avocados</a> and other fruit of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauraceae" title="Lauraceae">laurel family</a>, which the birds swallow whole before regurgitating the pits, which helps to disperse these trees.
Resplendent Quetzals usually live alone when not breeding. They are monogamous territorial breeders, with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)" title="Territory (animal)">territory</a> size being measured in Guatemala as 6-10 ha. They are also seasonal breeders, with the breeding season being March to April in Mexico, May to June in El Salvador and March to May in Guatemala.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> When breeding, females lay two pale blue eggs in a nest placed in a hole which they carve in a rotten tree. A tree in the required stage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition" title="Decomposition">decomposition</a> is susceptible to weather damage, and the availability of suitable trees may limit the Resplendent Quetzal population.
Both parents take turns at incubating, with their long tail-covert feathers folded forwards over the back and out of the hole, where they tend to look like a bunch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern" title="Fern">fern</a> growing out of the hole. The incubation period lasts about 18 days, during which the male generally incubates the eggs during the day while the female incubates them at night. When the eggs hatch, both parents take care of the young, feeding them fruit, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry" title="Berry">berries</a>, insects, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard" title="Lizard">lizards</a>, and small frogs. However, the female often neglects and even abandons the young near the end of the rearing period, leaving it up to the male to continue caring for the offspring until they are ready to survive on their own.
The Resplendent Quetzal is classed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_threatened" title="Near threatened" class="mw-redirect">near threatened</a> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Resplendent Quetzal was considered divine, associated with the "snake god", <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatl" title="Quetzalcoatl">Quetzalcoatl</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian" title="Pre-Columbian" class="mw-redirect">Pre-Columbian</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica" title="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerican</a> civilizations. Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence" title="Iridescence">iridescent</a> green tail feathers, symbols for spring plant growth, were venerated by the ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec" title="Aztec">Aztecs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization" title="Maya civilization">Maya</a>, who viewed the quetzal as the "god of the air" and as a symbol of goodness and light. Mesoamerican rulers and some nobility of other ranks wore headdresses made from quetzal feathers, symbolically connecting them to Quetzalcoatl. Since it was a crime to kill a quetzal, the bird was simply captured, its long tail feathers plucked, and was set free. Quetzalcoatl was the creator god and god of wind, often depicted with grey hair. In several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_languages" title="Mesoamerican languages">Mesoamerican languages</a>, the term for <i>quetzal</i> can also mean <i>precious</i>, <i>sacred</i>, or <i>erected</i>.
Until recently, it was thought that the Resplendent Quetzal could not be bred or held for any long time in captivity, and indeed it was noted for usually killing itself soon after being captured or caged. For this reason it is a traditional symbol of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_(political)" title="Freedom (political)" class="mw-redirect">liberty</a>. However, a zoo in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> has kept this species since 1992, and in 2004 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_breeding" title="Captive breeding">breeding in captivity</a> was announced (Orellana, 2004).
The bird is of great relevance to Guatemalan culture, being a character in the widely popular legend of the local hero <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tec%C3%BAn_Um%C3%A1n" title="Tecún Umán" class="mw-redirect">Tecún Umán</a>, a prince and warrior of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%27iche%27_people" title="K'iche' people">Quiché (K'iche') Maya</a> during the latter stages of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_Yucat%C3%A1n" title="Spanish conquest of Yucatán">Spanish conquest of the region</a>. This quetzal was his <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagual" title="Nagual">nahual</a></i> (spirit guide). The Quiché repelled several attacks from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spanish</a> army, even though outmatched in weaponry (guns, armor and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalry" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear" title="Spear">spears</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow" title="Arrow">arrows</a>).
Legend has it that on the day the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquistador" title="Conquistador">conquistador</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_de_Alvarado" title="Pedro de Alvarado">Pedro de Alvarado</a> fought against Tecún Umán, there was a quetzal flying overhead. On the first strike Tecún Umán, on foot, managed to disable Pedro de Alvarado's horse. Alvarado was then given another horse and on the second strike ran through Tecún Umán's chest with a spear. The quetzal flew down and landed on Tecún Umán, dipping its chest in the warrior prince's blood. It is there that the bird acquired its distinctive red chest feathers. <sup><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Pharomachrus_mocinno.html">[3]</a></sup>
It is debatable whether these events happened, but the Maya fought fiercely for their land and freedom during the conquest. One <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_mythology" title="Maya mythology">Mayan legend</a> claims that the quetzal used to sing beautifully before the Spanish conquest, but has been silent ever since; it will sing once again only when the land is truly free.
