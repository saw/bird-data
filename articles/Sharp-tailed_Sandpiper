The <b>Sharp-tailed Sandpiper</b> (<i>Calidris acuminata</i>) (but see below) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">wader</a>.
More recently, a review of new data has indicated that this bird should perhaps better be placed into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i>Philomachus</i> - as <i>P. acuminatus</i> - which now contains only the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruff_(bird)" title="Ruff (bird)" class="mw-redirect">ruff</a> but if the Sharp-tailed Sandpiper is merged into it would need to accommodate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-billed_Sandpiper" title="Broad-billed Sandpiper">Broad-billed Sandpiper</a> also (Thomas <i>et al.</i>, 2004).
While the latter certainly is a most peculiar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calidrid" title="Calidrid">calidrid</a>, the Sharp-tailed Sandpiper is much more similar to other <i>Calidris</i>/<i>Erolia</i> species such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectoral_Sandpiper" title="Pectoral Sandpiper">Pectoral Sandpiper</a>. On the one hand, its larger size and long-legged stance, and the breast pattern which gradually fades away on the belly as in the Ruff instead of having a fairly sharp border as in the <i>Calidris</i>/<i>Erolia</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stint" title="Stint">stints</a> indicate that placement in <i>Philomachus</i> may be correct. Still, it is just as possible that - given the fairly common instances of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridisation_in_shorebirds#Hybrids_in_the_Scolopaci_.28typical_waders.29" title="Hybridisation in shorebirds">hybridization in calidrines</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA" title="Mitochondrial DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> data has given a false picture of this species' true affinities. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curlew_Sandpiper" title="Curlew Sandpiper">Curlew Sandpiper</a>, which is a proposed parent of the hybrid called "<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridisation_in_shorebirds#.22Cooper.27s_Sandpiper.22" title="Hybridisation in shorebirds">Cooper's Sandpiper</a></b>" (<i>"Calidris"</i> Ã— <i>cooperi</i>) together with the Sharp-tailed Sandpiper, is another unusual calidrid that is hard to place systematically.
It breeds in the boggy tundra of northeast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a> and is strongly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering in south east Asia and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia" title="Australasia">Australasia</a>. It occurs as a rare autumn migrant to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, but in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> only as a very rare vagrant.
Breeding adults are a rich brown with darker feather centres above, and white underneath apart from a buff breast. They have a light superciliary line above the eye and a chestnut crown. In winter, Sharp-tailed Sandpipers are grey above. The juveniles are brightly patterned above with rufous colouration and white mantle stripes.
This bird looks a lot like the Pectoral Sandpiper, within whose Asian range it breeds. It differs from that species in its breast pattern, stronger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercilium" title="Supercilium">supercilium</a> and more rufous crown. It has some similarities to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-toed_Stint" title="Long-toed Stint">Long-toed Stint</a>, but is much larger than that tiny <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stint" title="Stint">stint</a>.
Little is known of the breeding habits of this species, although it nests on the ground, and the male has a display flight.
These birds forage on grasslands and mudflats, like the Pectoral Sandpiper, picking up food by sight, sometimes by probing. They mainly eat insects and other invertebrates.
