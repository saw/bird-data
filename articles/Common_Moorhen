<i>Gallinula brodkorbi</i> <small>McCoy, 1963</small><br />
<i>Gallinula galeata</i>
The <b>Common Moorhen</b> (<i>Gallinula chloropus</i>) (also known as the "swamp chicken"<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>) is a bird in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallidae" title="Rallidae">Rallidae</a> family with an almost worldwide distribution. The North and South American Committees of the AOU and the IOC have voted on or before July 2011 to split the American forms into a new species Common Gallinule, however, no other committee has voted to change taxonomy yet. In that light, the American forms can now be found under a separate species listing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gallinule" title="Common Gallinule">Common Gallinule</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> however all forms can still be found here until further actions are taken. It lives around well-vegetated marshes, ponds, canals and other wetlands. The species is not found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_regions" title="Polar regions" class="mw-redirect">polar regions</a>, or many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest" title="Tropical rainforest">tropical rainforests</a>. But elsewhere the Common Moorhen is likely the most commonly seen rail species to most people, excepting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Coot" title="Eurasian Coot">Eurasian Coot</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Coot" title="American Coot">American Coot</a> in some regions.
The name <i>mor-hen</i> has been recorded in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> since the 13th century,<sup id="cite_ref-PDBBN_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PDBBN-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> and the word <i>moor</i> here is an old sense meaning <i>marsh</i><sup id="cite_ref-PDBBN_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PDBBN-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> – the species is not usually found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorland" title="Moorland">moorland</a>. An older alternative name, <b>Common Waterhen</b>, is a more descriptive because of the bird's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a>.
A "Watercock" is not a male "Waterhen", but the rail species <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallicrex_cinerea" title="Gallicrex cinerea" class="mw-redirect">Gallicrex cinerea</a></i>, not closely related to the Common Moorhen. "Water Rail" usually refers to <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallus_aquaticus" title="Rallus aquaticus" class="mw-redirect">Rallus aquaticus</a></i>, again not closely related.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_name" title="Scientific name" class="mw-redirect">scientific name</a> <i>Gallinula chloropus</i> comes from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>Gallinula</i> (a small hen or chicken) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> <i>chloropus</i> (<i>khloros</i> <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%87%CE%BB%CF%89%CF%81%CF%8C%CF%82" class="extiw" title="wikt:χλωρός">χλωρός</a> green or yellow, <i>pous</i> <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%8D%CF%82" class="extiw" title="wikt:πούς">πούς</a> foot).<sup id="cite_ref-DSBN_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DSBN-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Moorhen is a distinctive species, with dark plumage apart from the white undertail, yellow legs and a red facial shield. The young are browner and lack the red shield. It has a wide range of gargling calls and will emit loud hisses when threatened.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> A mid-to-large sized rail, it can range from 30 to 38 cm (12 to 15 in) in length and span 50 to 62 cm (20 to 24 in) across the wings. The body mass of this species can range from 192 to 500 g (6.8 to 18 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
This is a common breeding bird in marsh environments and well-vegetated lakes. Populations in areas where the waters freeze, such as southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, the northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">USA</a> and eastern Europe, will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to more temperate climes. This species will consume a wide variety of vegetable material and small aquatic creatures. They forage beside or in the water, sometimes upending in the water to feed. It is often secretive, but can become tame in some areas. Despite loss of habitat in parts of its range, the Common Moorhen remains plentiful and widespread. They fight over territories and also hop around Lily pads.
The nest is a basket built on the ground in dense vegetation. Laying starts in spring, between mid-March and mid-May in N hemisphere temperate regions. About 8 eggs are usually laid per female early in the season; a brood later in the year usually has only 5–8 or fewer eggs. Nests may be re-used by different females. Incubation lasts about three weeks. Both parents <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubate_(bird)" title="Incubate (bird)" class="mw-redirect">incubate</a> and feed the young. These fledge after 40–50 days, become independent usually a few weeks thereafter, and may raise their first brood the next spring. When threatened, the young may cling to the parents' body, after which the adult birds fly away to safety, carrying their offspring with them.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>

Despite being an abundant and widespread species, small populations are more prone to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct" title="Extinct" class="mw-redirect">extinction</a>. The Hawaiian Moorhen or <i>ʻalae ʻula</i> (<i>G. c. sandvicensis</i>) is suspected to be threatened by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Indian_Mongoose" title="Small Indian Mongoose" class="mw-redirect">Small Indian Mongoose</a> (<i>Herpestes javanicus</i>) which was introduced to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands" title="Hawaiian Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a> to hunt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a> but found the local birdlife easier prey. The Mariana Common Moorhen or <i>pulattat</i> (<i>G. c. guami</i>) is very rare nowadays due to destruction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a>. Only some 300 adult birds remained in 2001, and it is listed as Endangered both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act" title="Endangered Species Act">federally</a> (since 1984) and locally.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
The population of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palau" title="Palau">Palau</a>, belonging to the widespread subspecies <i>G. c. orientalis</i> and locally known as <i>debar</i> (a generic term also used for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducks" title="Ducks" class="mw-redirect">ducks</a> and meaning roughly "waterfowl"), is also very rare, and apparently the birds are hunted by locals. Most of the population on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago" title="Archipelago">archipelago</a> occurs on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angaur" title="Angaur">Angaur</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peleliu" title="Peleliu">Peleliu</a>, while the species is probably already gone from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koror" title="Koror">Koror</a>.

On a global scale – all subspecies taken together – the Common Moorhen is as abundant as its vernacular name implies. It is therefore considered a species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern" title="Least Concern">Least Concern</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Common Moorhen is one of the birds (the other is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Coot" title="Eurasian Coot">Eurasian Coot</a>, <i>Fulica atra</i>) from which the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclocoelidae" title="Cyclocoelidae">cyclocoelid</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatworm" title="Flatworm">flatworm</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite" title="Parasite" class="mw-redirect">parasite</a> <i>Cyclocoelum mutabile</i> was first described.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> This species is parasitised by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorhen_flea" title="Moorhen flea">moorhen flea</a>, <i>Dasypsyllus gallinulae</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Rothschild_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rothschild-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
About one dozen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> are today considered valid; several more have been described which are now considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_synonym" title="Junior synonym" class="mw-redirect">junior synonyms</a>. Most are not very readily recognizable as differences are rather subtle and often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(biology)" title="Cline (biology)">clinal</a>. Usually, the location of a sighting is the most reliable indication as to subspecies identification, but the migratory tendencies of this species make identifications based on location not completely reliable. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World" title="Old World">Old World</a> birds have a frontal shield with rounded top and fairly parallel sides; the tailward margin of the red unfeathered area is a smooth waving line. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">American</a> birds have a frontal shield that has a fairly straight top and is less wide towards the bill, giving a marked indentation to the back margin of the red area.
In addition to the extant subspecies listed below, there are two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene" title="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> populations known from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil" title="Fossil">fossils</a>; they were distinct (generally larger) birds and probably the direct ancestors of some of today's Common Moorhens: The stout and long-winged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleosubspecies" title="Paleosubspecies" class="mw-redirect">paleosubspecies</a> <i>G. c. brodkorbi</i> is known from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichetucknee_River" title="Ichetucknee River">Ichetucknee River</a> deposits in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>; it was originally described as a distinct species. The presence of fossils typical of the shorter-winged and more delicate <i>G. c. cerceris</i> in the same deposits suggests that <i>brodkorbi</i> was not ancestral to the "Florida Gallinule" of our time but rather to the more northernly "Common Gallinule". An undescribed form is recorded from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Pleistocene" title="Early Pleistocene">Early Pleistocene</a> of Dursunlu in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
