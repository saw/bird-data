The <b>Harlequin Duck</b> (<i>Histrionicus histrionicus</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merginae" title="Merginae">sea duck</a>. It takes its name from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlecchino" title="Arlecchino" class="mw-redirect">Arlecchino</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin" title="Harlequin">Harlequin</a> in French, a colourfully dressed character in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27arte" title="Commedia dell'arte">Commedia dell'arte</a>. The species name comes from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word "histrio", "actor". In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> it is also known as <b>Lords and ladies</b>. Other names include <i>painted duck</i>, <i>totem pole duck</i>, <i>rock duck</i>, <i>glacier duck</i>, <i>mountain duck</i>, <i>white-eyed diver</i>, <i>squeaker</i> and <i>blue streak</i>.
Adult males are slate blue with chestnut sides and white markings including a white crescent at the base of the bill. Adult females are less colourful, with brownish-grey plumage and a white patch on the head around the eye. Both adults have a white ear-patch.
Their breeding habitat is cold fast moving streams in north-western and north-eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>. The nest is usually located in a well-concealed location on the ground near a stream. They are usually found near pounding surf and white water. They are short distance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrants</a> and most winter near rocky shorelines on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. They are very rare migrants to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>.
The eastern North American population is declining and is considered endangered. Possible causes include loss of habitat due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectric" title="Hydroelectric" class="mw-redirect">hydroelectric</a> projects and loss of life due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_spill" title="Oil spill">oil spills</a> near coastal areas.
These <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a> feed by swimming under water or diving. They also dabble. They eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusc" title="Mollusc" class="mw-redirect">molluscs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insects" title="Insects" class="mw-redirect">insects</a>. Harlequins have smooth, densely packed feathers that trap a lot of air within them. This is vital for insulating such small bodies against the chilly waters they ply. It also makes them exceptionally buoyant, making them bounce like corks after dives.
Today, this is the only species of its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a>. Two prehistoric harlequin ducks were described from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil" title="Fossil">fossils</a>, although both were initially placed in a distinct genus: <i>Histrionicus shotwelli</i> is known from Middle to Late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene" title="Miocene">Miocene</a> deposits of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon" title="Oregon">Oregon</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">USA</a> and was considered to form a distinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic" title="Monotypic" class="mw-redirect">monotypic</a> genus, <i>Ocyplonessa</i>. <i>Histrionicus ceruttii</i>, which lived in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> during the Late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene" title="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>, was at first taken to be a species of the related genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanitta" title="Melanitta" class="mw-redirect">Melanitta</a></i>. The species is traditionally considered monotypic. The Eastern and Western populations are sometimes recognized as two different subspecies, the Eastern race being the nominate <i>H. histrionicus histrionicus</i>, and the Western race as <i>H. h. pacificus</i>, but there has been doubt on the validity of this taxon.
