The <b>Black-necked Grebe</b> (<i>Podiceps nigricollis</i>) known in North America as the <b>Eared Grebe</b>, is a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grebe" title="Grebe">grebe</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> of water birds. It occurs on every continent except <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>.
There are three subspecies:<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The two common names for this species both refer to features visible when the bird is in its breeding plumage; in such plumage, it has an all-black neck and a spray of golden plumes on each side of its head. The name "Eared Grebe" was in usage nearly a century before the name "Black-necked Grebe". The latter was first used in 1912 by Ernst Hartert, in an effort to bring the common name of the species in line with its scientific name.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The genus name of this species—<i>Podiceps</i>—comes from two Latin words: <i>podicis</i>, meaning "vent" or "anus" and <i>pes</i> meaning "foot".<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> This is a reference to the attachment point of the bird's legs—at the extreme back end of its body. The specific epithet <i>nigricollis</i> is Latin for "black-necked": <i>niger</i> means "black" and <i>collis</i> means "neck".
The Black-necked Grebe is 28–34 centimetres (11–13 in) long. The adult is unmistakable in summer with a black head and neck and yellow ear tufts. In winter, this small grebe is white with a poorly defined black cap, which distinguishes it from the crisper-looking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavonian_Grebe" title="Slavonian Grebe" class="mw-redirect">Slavonian Grebe</a> (Horned Grebe in America).
In courtship the male gives a mellow <i>poo-ee-chk</i> call to the female.
This species breeds in vegetated areas of freshwater <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakes" title="Lakes" class="mw-redirect">lakes</a> across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> and the southwest and western United States.

These birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> in winter, mostly to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Coast" title="Pacific Coast" class="mw-redirect">Pacific Coast</a> where they range south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a> on a regular basis; vagrants may occur as far as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Black-necked Grebes of the nominate subspecies <i>P. n. nigricollis</i> in the cooler temperate regions of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World" title="Old World">Old World</a> also winter further south, with many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds" title="Birds" class="mw-redirect">birds</a> moving to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean" title="Mediterranean" class="mw-redirect">Mediterranean</a> area. The isolated southern African race, <i>P. n. gurneyi</i> is sedentary. It was named by South African <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithologist" title="Ornithologist" class="mw-redirect">ornithologist</a> and author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Roberts" title="Austin Roberts">Austin Roberts</a> in honour of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">English</a> bankers and amateur ornithologists <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Gurney" title="John Henry Gurney" class="mw-redirect">John Henry Gurney</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=John_Henry_Gurney_Jr.&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="John Henry Gurney Jr. (page does not exist)">John Henry Gurney Jr.</a>.
Sadly the large breeding population in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Roscommon" title="County Roscommon">County Roscommon</a>, Ireland discovered about 1915 fell victim to a drainage scheme in the late 1930s; at its peak there were an estimated 250 pairs. Breeding, in very small numbers, was suspected in Ireland in 2002, 2006 and 2011.

The Black-necked Grebe is an excellent swimmer and diver, and pursues its prey underwater, eating mostly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> as well as small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustaceans" title="Crustaceans" class="mw-redirect">crustaceans</a>, aquatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva" title="Larva">larvae</a>. It prefers to escape danger by diving rather than flying, although it can easily rise from the water.
Like all grebes, the Black-necked Grebe nests on the water's edge, since its legs are set very far back and it cannot walk well. Usually two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> are laid, and the striped young are sometimes carried on the adult's back.
Interestingly, the eared grebe is essentially flightless for most of the year (9 to 10 months), and serves as an example of one of the most inefficient flier among avifauna. Generally, this bird avoids flying at all costs and reserves long distance flight exclusively for migration. However, when migrating, it will travel as much as 6,000 kilometres (3,700&nbsp;mi) to reach prosperous areas which are exploited by few other species.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
