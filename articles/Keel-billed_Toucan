The <b>Keel-billed Toucan</b> (<i>Ramphastos sulfuratus</i>), also known as <b>Sulfur-breasted Toucan</b> or <b>Rainbow-billed Toucan</b>, is a colorful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toucan" title="Toucan">toucan</a> family. It is the national bird of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize" title="Belize">Belize</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Including its bill, the Keel-billed Toucans ranges in length from around 17 to 22&nbsp;inches (42–55&nbsp;cm).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Their large and colorful bill averages around 5-6 in (12–15&nbsp;cm), about one-third of its length. It typically weighs about 380-500 grams (13.4 oz.-1.1&nbsp;lbs.)<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> While the bill seems large and cumbersome, it is in fact a spongy, hollow bone covered in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin" title="Keratin">keratin</a>, a very light and hard protein.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">plumage</a> of the Keel-billed Toucan is mainly black with a yellow neck and chest. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moult" title="Moult" class="mw-redirect">Molting</a> occurs once per year.<sup id="cite_ref-vantyne1929_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vantyne1929-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> It has blue feet and red feathers at the tip of its tail. The bill is mainly green with a red tip and orange sides.
Keel-billed toucans have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygodactyl#Zygodactyly" title="Zygodactyl" class="mw-redirect">zygodactyl feet</a> (or feet with toes facing in different directions) - two toes face forward and two face back. Because toucans spend a large portion of time in the trees, this helps the birds to stay on the branches of the trees and hop from one branch to another.
The Keel-billed Toucan can be found from Southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>. It roosts in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canopy_(forest)" title="Canopy (forest)" class="mw-redirect">canopies</a> of tropical, subtropical, and lowland rainforests, up to altitudes of 1,900 m.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> It roosts in holes in trees,<sup id="cite_ref-vantyne1929_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vantyne1929-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> often with several other toucans. This can be very cramped, so the birds tuck their tails and beaks under their bodies to conserve space while sleeping. Adding to the lack of space, the bottoms of the holes are often covered with pits from the fruit the toucans have eaten.<sup id="cite_ref-vantyne1929_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vantyne1929-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Like many toucans, Keel-billed is a very social bird, rarely seen alone. It travels in small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd" title="Herd">flocks</a> of approximately six to twelve individuals through lowland <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest" title="Rainforest">rainforests</a>; it is a poor flyer, and moves mostly by hopping through trees. It has a family structure within the group. Birds will often "duel" with each other using their bills, and throw fruit into each other's mouths. Keel-billed Toucans live together in these groups, often sharing cramped living quarters of holes in trees. Able to utilize human-altered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a> to some extent,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> this widespread bird is considered to be a Species of Least Concern by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The diet of Keel-billed Toucans consists mostly of a wide range of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> but may also include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insects" title="Insects" class="mw-redirect">insects</a>, eggs, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptiles" title="Reptiles" class="mw-redirect">reptiles</a>. The bill, surprisingly dexterous, allows this toucan to utilize a large variety of fruit that might not otherwise be reached. When eating the fruit, it uses its bill to dissect the fruit, and then tosses its head back to swallow the fruit whole.
The female Keel-billed Toucan will lay 1-4 white eggs in a natural or already-made tree cavity.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> The male and female share in the caring of the eggs, both taking turns incubating.<sup id="cite_ref-vantyne1929_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vantyne1929-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The eggs hatch approximately 15–20 days after being laid. After hatching, the male and female again take turns feeding the chicks. When the chicks hatch, they have no feathers, and have their eyes closed for approximately 3 weeks. The chicks have adequately formed heel pads, which assist on the pit-covered bottom of the nest.<sup id="cite_ref-vantyne1929_5-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vantyne1929-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The chicks stay in their nest for approximately eight to nine weeks while their bills develop fully and they are ready to fledge from the nest.
