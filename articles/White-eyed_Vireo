It breeds in the southeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">USA</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> west to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri" title="Missouri">Missouri</a> and south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>, and also in eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamas" title="Bahamas" class="mw-redirect">Bahamas</a>.
Populations on the US <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast" title="Gulf Coast" class="mw-redirect">Gulf coast</a> and further south are resident, but most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> south in winter.
This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vireo" title="Vireo">vireo</a> frequents bushes and shrubs in abandoned cultivation or overgrown pastures. The grass-lined nest is a neat cup shape, attached to a fork in a tree branch by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spider</a> webs. 3-5 dark-spotted white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> are laid. Both the male and female incubate the eggs for 12 – 16 days. The young leave the nest 9 – 11 days after hatching.
The White-eyed Vireo is 13 – 15&nbsp;cm in length. Its head and back are a greyish olive, and the underparts are white with yellow flanks. The wings and tail are dark, and there are two white wing bars on each wing. The eyes have white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" title="Iris (anatomy)">irises</a>, and are surrounded by yellow spectacles. Sexes are similar.
The White-eyed Vireo's song is a variable and rapid six to seven note phrase, starting and ending with a sharp <i>chick</i>.

Several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognized for the White-eyed Vireo. Geographic ranges for subspecies are not entirely clear.
The northern subspecies, <i>V. g. noveboracensis</i>, occupies most of the range of this species and is fully migratory. This sub-species is larger and has more brightly colored plumage than all other subspecies.
The resident southeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_plain" title="Coastal plain">coastal plain</a> race, <i>V. g. griseus</i> is a slightly smaller and duller colored subspecies. It does not typically migrate out of its breeding range in the winter.
The resident <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Keys" title="Florida Keys">Florida Keys</a> race, <i>V. g. maynardi</i>, is greyer above and whiter below, and the south Texan <i>V. g. micrus</i> is like a smaller <i>maynardi</i>.
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.conservation.bm/white-eyed-vireo/"><i>V. g. bermudianus</i></a>, is endemic to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. This has shorter wings and a duller plumage. Along with other endemic and native Bermudian birds, it was threatened with extinction following the loss of 8 million <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_cedar" title="Bermuda cedar" class="mw-redirect">Bermuda cedar</a> trees in the 1940s, and is now quite rare. This species is listed under the Bermuda Protected Species Act 2003.
