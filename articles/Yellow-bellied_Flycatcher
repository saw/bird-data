Adults have greenish upperparts and yellowish underparts (especially on the throat), with a dusky wash on the chest. They have a white or yellow eye ring that lacks the teardrop projection of Pacific-slope (<i>E. difficilis</i>) or Cordilleran (<i>E. occidentalis</i>) Flycatchers, white or yellowish wing bars that contrast strongly against the black wings, a broad, flat bill, and a relatively short tail when compared to other members of the genus. The upper mandible of the bill is dark, while the lower mandible is orange-pink.
Their breeding habitat is wet northern woods, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce" title="Spruce">spruce</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog" title="Bog">bogs</a>, across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the northeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>.

The Yellow-bellied Flycatcher's song can be transcribed as a rough, descending "TSE-berk," which can be similar to the more common Least Flycatcher's snappier, more evenly pitched "che-bek." The three primary call notes of Yellow-bellied Flycatcher are a clear, ascending "chu-wee," a sharp, gruff "peekk", and a soft, descending "pyu."
