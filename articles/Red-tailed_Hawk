Red-tailed Hawks can acclimate to all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome" title="Biome">biomes</a> within their range. There are fourteen recognized subspecies, which vary in appearance and range. It is one of the largest members of the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteo" title="Buteo">Buteo</a></i> in North America, typically weighing from 690 to 1600&nbsp;grams (1.5 to 3.5&nbsp;pounds) and measuring 45–65&nbsp;cm (18 to 26&nbsp;in) in length, with a wingspan from 110 to 145&nbsp;cm (43 to 57&nbsp;in). The Red-tailed Hawk displays <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in size, with females averaging about 25% heavier than males.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The <b>Harlan's Hawk</b> (<i>B. j. harlani</i>), often considered a separate species, is treated below in the Taxonomy section.
The Red-tailed Hawk occupies a wide range of habitats and altitudes, including deserts, grasslands, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coniferous" title="Coniferous" class="mw-redirect">coniferous</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> forests, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest" title="Tropical rainforest">tropical rainforests</a>, agricultural fields and urban areas. It lives throughout the North American continent, except in areas of unbroken forest or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">high arctic</a>. It is legally protected in Canada, Mexico and the United States by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act" title="Migratory Bird Treaty Act" class="mw-redirect">Migratory Bird Treaty Act</a>.
Because they are so common and easily trained as capable hunters, the majority of hawks captured for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry" title="Falconry">falconry</a> in the United States are Red-tails. Falconers are permitted to take only passage hawks (which have left the nest, are on their own, but are less than a year old) so as to not affect the breeding population. Adults, which may be breeding or rearing chicks, may not be taken for falconry purposes and it is illegal to do so. Passage red-tailed hawks are also preferred by falconers because these younger birds have not yet developed adult behaviors, which can make training substantially more challenging.
A male Red-Tailed Hawk may weigh from 690 to 1300&nbsp;g (1.5 to 2.9&nbsp;lb), with a mean weight of 1,030&nbsp;g (2.3&nbsp;lb), and measure 45–60 cm (18–24 in). A female can weigh between 900 and 2000&nbsp;g (2 and 4.4&nbsp;lb), averaging 1,220&nbsp;g (2.7&nbsp;lb), and measure 48 to 65&nbsp;cm (19 to 26 in) long). The wingspan can range from 105 to 141 cm (41 to 56 in) and, in the standard scientific method of measuring wing size, the wing bone is 33–44 cm (13–17 in) long. The tail measures 19–25 cm (7.5–9.8 in) in length.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CRC_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmen_(bird)" title="Culmen (bird)" class="mw-redirect">exposed culmen</a> was reported to average 2.5–2.7 cm (0.98–1.1 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> averaged 8.6–9 cm (3.4–3.5 in).<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> As is the case with many raptors the Red-tailed Hawk displays <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in size, as females are up to 25% larger than males.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
Red-tailed Hawk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> can be variable, depending on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> and the region.

The western North American population, <i>B. j. calurus</i>, is the most variable subspecies and has three color morphs: light, dark, and intermediate or rufus. The dark and intermediate morphs constitute 10–20% of the population.<sup id="cite_ref-Land_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Land-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
Though the markings and hue vary across the subspecies, the basic appearance of the Red-tailed Hawk is consistent. Overall, this species is blocky and broad in shape, often appearing (and being) heavier than other <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteo" title="Buteo">Buteos</a></i> of similar length.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> A whitish underbelly with a dark brown band across the belly, formed by horizontal streaks in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">feather</a> patterning, is present in most color variations. Especially in younger birds, the underside may be otherwise covered with dark brown spotting.

There are at least 14 recognized subspecies of <i>Buteo jamaicensis</i>, which vary in range and in coloration:
The four island forms, <i>jamaicensis</i>, <i>solitudinus</i>, <i>socorroensis</i>, and <i>fumosus</i>, do not overlap in range with any other subspecies.
The Red-tailed Hawk is one of the most widely distributed hawks in the Americas. It breeds from central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon" title="Yukon">Yukon</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territories" title="Northwest Territories">Northwest Territories</a> east to southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_Provinces" title="Maritime Provinces" class="mw-redirect">Maritime Provinces</a> of Canada, and south to Florida, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies" title="West Indies" class="mw-redirect">West Indies</a>, and Central America.

The Red-tailed Hawk is widespread in North America,<sup id="cite_ref-SF_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SF-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> partially due to historic settlement patterns, which have benefited it. The clearing of forests in the Northeast created hunting areas, while the preservation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodlot" title="Woodlot">woodlots</a> left the species with viable nest sites. The planting of trees in the west allowed the Red-tailed Hawk to expand its range by creating nest sites where there had been none. The construction of highways with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_pole" title="Utility pole">utility poles</a> alongside treeless medians provided perfect habitat for perch-hunting. Unlike some other raptors, the Red-tailed Hawk are seemingly unfazed by considerable human activity and can nest and live in close proximity to large numbers of humans.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Thus, the species can also be found in cities, where common prey such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_pigeon" title="Rock pigeon" class="mw-redirect">rock pigeons</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rat" title="Brown rat">brown rats</a> may support their populations.<sup id="cite_ref-Avian_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Avian-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> One urban Red-tailed Hawk, known as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Male" title="Pale Male">Pale Male</a>", became famous for being the first Red-tail in decades to successfully nest and raise young in the crowded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> borough of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>
In flight, this hawk soars with wings often in a slight <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_angle" title="Dihedral angle">dihedral</a>, flapping as little as possible to conserve energy.

During courtship, the male and female fly in wide circles while uttering shrill cries. The male performs aerial displays, diving steeply, and then climbing again.

Courtship flights can last 10 minutes or more. Copulation often follows courtship flight sequences, although copulation frequently occurs in the absence of courtship flights.
In copulation, the female, when perched, tilts forward, allowing the male to land with his feet lodged on her horizontal back. The female twists and moves her tail feathers to one side, while the mounted male twists his cloacal opening around the female's cloaca. Copulation lasts 5 to 10 seconds and during pre-nesting courtship in late winter or early spring can occur numerous times each day.<sup id="cite_ref-Oiseaux_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Oiseaux-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup>
In the same period, the pair constructs a stick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> in a large tree 4 to 21 m (13 to 69 ft) off the ground or on a cliff ledge 35&nbsp;m (115&nbsp;ft) or higher above the ground, or may nest on man-made structures. The nest is generally 71 to 97&nbsp;cm (28 to 38&nbsp;inches) in diameter and can be up to 90&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;ft) tall. The nest is constructed of twigs, and lined with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark" title="Bark">bark</a>, pine needles, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_cob" title="Corn cob" class="mw-redirect">corn cobs</a>, husks, stalks, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen" title="Aspen">aspen</a> catkins, or other plant lining matter.
Great Horned Owls compete with the Red-tailed Hawk for nest sites. Each species has been known to kill the young and destroy the eggs of the other, but in general, both species nest in adjacent or confluent territories without conflict. Great Horned Owls are incapable of constructing nests and typically expropriate existing Red-tail nests. Great Horned Owls begin nesting behaviors much earlier than Red-tails, often as early as December. Red-tails are therefore adapted to constructing new nests when a previous year's nest has been overtaken by owls or otherwise lost. New nests are typically within a kilometer or less of the previous nest. Often, a new nest is only a few hundred meters or less from a previous one. Being a large predator, most predation of these hawks occurs with eggs and nestlings, which are taken by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvid" title="Corvid" class="mw-redirect">corvids</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon" title="Raccoon">raccoons</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup>
A clutch of 1 to 3 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> is laid in March or April, depending upon latitude. Clutch size depends almost exclusively on the availability of prey for the adults. Eggs are laid approximately every other day. The eggs are usually about 60 x 47&nbsp;mm (2.4 x 1.9&nbsp;in). They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubated</a> primarily by female, with the male substituting when the female leaves to hunt or merely stretch her wings. The male brings most food to the female while she incubates. After 28 to 35 days, the eggs hatch over 2 to 4 days; the nestlings are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" title="Altricial">altricial</a> at hatching. The female broods them while the male provides most of the food to the female and the young, which are known as eyasses (pronounced "EYE-ess-ez"). The female feeds the eyasses after tearing the food into small pieces. After 42 to 46 days, the eyasses begin to leave the nest. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledging</a> period follows, with short flights engaged in, after another 3 weeks. About 6 to 7 weeks after fledging, the young begin to capture their own prey. Shortly thereafter, when the young are around 4 months of age, they become independent of their parents. However, the hawks do not generally reach breeding maturity until they are around 3 years of age. In the wild, Red-tailed Hawks have lived for at least 21 years. The oldest captive hawk of this species was at least 29 and a half years of age.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_8-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Red-tailed Hawk is a popular bird in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry" title="Falconry">falconry</a>, particularly in the United States where the sport of falconry is tightly regulated at the federal and state levels. There are fewer than 5,000 falconers in the United States, therefore any effect on the Red-tailed Hawk population, estimated to be about one million in the United States, is statistically insignificant.<sup id="cite_ref-Federal_Register_34-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Federal_Register-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup>
In the course of a hunt, a falconer using a Red-tailed Hawk most commonly releases the hawk and allows it to perch in a tree or other high vantage point. The falconer, who may be aided by a dog, then attempts to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#Methods" title="Hunting">flush</a> prey by stirring up ground cover. A well-trained Red-tailed Hawk will follow the falconer and dog, realizing that their activities produce opportunities to catch game. Once a raptor catches game, it does not bring it back to the falconer. Instead, the falconer must locate the bird and its captured prey, "make in", (carefully approach) and trade the bird its kill in exchange for a piece of offered meat.<sup id="cite_ref-McGranaghan_35-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-McGranaghan-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup>
