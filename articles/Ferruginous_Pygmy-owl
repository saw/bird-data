The <b>Ferruginous Pygmy Owl</b> (<i>Glaucidium brasilianum</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owl</a> that breeds in south-central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">USA</a>, south through to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, as well as other localities, have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism_in_birds" title="Endemism in birds" class="mw-redirect">endemic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> of this owl. Recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics" title="Genetics">genetics</a> work has found substantial differences in Ferruginous Pygmy Owls from different regions, and members of the northern <i>ridgwayi</i> group are sometimes considered a separate species, the <b>Ridgeway's Pygmy-owl</b> (<i>Glaucidium ridgwayi</i>).This species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typical_owl" title="Typical owl" class="mw-redirect">typical owls</a>, Strigidae, the family that contains most species of owl. The other grouping is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_owl" title="Barn owl" class="mw-redirect">barn owls</a>, Tytonidae. In the southern portion of its range, the Ferruginous Pygmy Owl is generally a common bird found in a wide range of semi-open wooded habitats.
Their mating season is from late winter to early spring. It is a cavity nesting bird (tree and columnar cactus cavities), laying 3-5 white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>. Incubation is 28 days, with 27â€“30 days to fledging.
The Ferruginous Pygmy Owl is small, typically 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in), and stocky with disproportionately large talons. The crown has elongated white/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buff_(colour)" title="Buff (colour)">buff</a> spots or streaks, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_coverts" title="Wing coverts" class="mw-redirect">wing coverts</a> have white spots, and the underparts are heavily streaked white. There are prominent white supercilia above the facial disc. There are two eye spots on the nape. Otherwise, its overall color is highly variable, ranging from grey-brown with a black-and-white barred tail to rich rufous with a uniform rufous tail. Sexes are similar with females slightly larger and often more reddish. The flight is low to the ground and rapid with long swoops. This species is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular" title="Crepuscular">crepuscular</a>, but often hunts by day. It can be readily located by the small birds that mob it while it is perched in a tree (up to 40 birds of 11 species have been recorded mobbing one owl). It hunts a variety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard" title="Lizard">lizards</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>.
The call is a whistled <i>hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo</i>, usually in E flat. It is easily imitated, and is used by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdwatching" title="Birdwatching">birdwatchers</a> to attract small birds intent on mobbing the pygmy owls.
The northernmost subspecies <i>cactorum</i>, popularly called the Cactus Ferruginous Pygmy Owl, was listed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered" title="Endangered" class="mw-redirect">Endangered</a> under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act" title="Endangered Species Act">ESA</a>. This refers to its range in the south-central portion of Arizona in the USA, where its range extended over the border from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora" title="Sonora">Sonora</a>, Mexico. It was delisted in 2006. The reasons for this are loss of habitat and buffel grass. This grass catches fire very easy and spreads to the cacti and burns the owl's primary habitat. In Central America and South America, it is the most widely distributed pygmy owl and is probably one of the most numerous owl species in those areas.
