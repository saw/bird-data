The American Robin is active mostly during the day and assembles in large flocks at night. Its diet consists of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva" title="Larva">beetle grubs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthworm" title="Earthworm">earthworms</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar" title="Caterpillar">caterpillars</a>), fruits and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry" title="Berry">berries</a>. It is one of the earliest bird species to lay eggs, beginning to breed shortly after returning to its summer range from its winter range. Its nest consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers, and is smeared with mud and often cushioned with grass or other soft materials. It is among the first birds to sing at dawn, and its song consists of several discrete units that are repeated.
The adult robin is preyed upon by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawks</a>, cats and larger snakes, but when feeding in flocks, it can be vigilant and watch other birds for reactions to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation" title="Predation">predators</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-headed_Cowbird" title="Brown-headed Cowbird">Brown-headed Cowbirds</a> lay eggs in robin nests (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite" title="Brood parasite">brood parasite</a>), but robins usually reject the cowbird eggs.

The American Robin has an extensive range, estimated at 16&nbsp;million&nbsp;square kilometers (6&nbsp;million square miles), and a large population of about 320&nbsp;million individuals. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern" title="Least Concern">Least Concern</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> At one point, the bird was killed for its meat, but it is now protected throughout its range in the United States by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act_of_1918" title="Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918">Migratory Bird Act</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_12-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>

The American Robin is a known reservoir (carrier) for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Nile_virus" title="West Nile virus">West Nile virus</a>.

This is because while crows and jays die quickly from the virus, the American Robin survives the virus longer, hence spreading it to more mosquitoes, which then transmit the virus to humans and other species.<sup id="cite_ref-NationalScienceFoundation2009_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NationalScienceFoundation2009-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ScienceNews_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ScienceNews-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup>
The American Robin is active mostly during the day, and on its winter grounds it assembles in large flocks at night to roost in trees in secluded swamps or dense vegetation. The flocks break up during the day when the birds feed on fruits and berries in smaller groups. During the summer, the American Robin defends a breeding territory and is less social.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_12-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
The American Robin's diet generally consists of around 40 percent invertebrates, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthworms" title="Earthworms" class="mw-redirect">earthworms</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva" title="Larva">beetle grubs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar" title="Caterpillar">caterpillars</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper" title="Grasshopper">grasshoppers</a>, and 60 percent wild and cultivated fruits and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry" title="Berry">berries</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_12-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> They will flock to fermented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyracantha" title="Pyracantha">Pyracantha</a> berries, and in sufficient quantities will exhibit intoxicated behavior such as falling over while walking. It forages primarily on the ground for soft-bodied invertebrates, and finds worms by sight, pouncing on them and then pulling them up.<sup id="cite_ref-All_About_Birds_16-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-All_About_Birds-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> Nestlings are fed mainly on worms and other soft-bodied animal prey. In some areas, Robins, particularly of the coastal race <i>T. m. caurinus</i> will feed on beaches, taking insects and small mollusks.<sup id="cite_ref-Clement_7-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Clement-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Robin uses auditory, visual, olfactory and possibly vibrotactile cues to ﬁnd prey, but vision is the predominant mode of prey detection.<sup id="cite_ref-montgomerie_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-montgomerie-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> It is frequently seen running across lawns, picking up earthworms and its <i>running and stopping</i> behavior is a distinguishing characteristic. It hunts visually, and it also has the ability to hunt by hearing. Experiments have discovered that it can find worms underground by simply using its listening skills.<sup id="cite_ref-montgomerie_25-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-montgomerie-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> It typically will take several short hops and then cock its head left, right or forward as a means to detect movement of its prey. In urban areas, robins will gather in numbers soon after lawns are mowed or where sprinklers are in use.<sup id="cite_ref-All_About_Birds_16-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-All_About_Birds-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>

The American Robin begins to breed shortly after returning to its summer range. It is one of the first North American bird species to lay eggs, and normally has two to three broods per breeding season, which lasts from April to July.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_12-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
The nest is most commonly located 1.5–4.5&nbsp;meters (5–15&nbsp;ft) above the ground in a dense bush or in a fork between two tree branches, and is built by the female alone. The outer foundation consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers. This is lined with smeared mud and cushioned with fine grass or other soft materials. A new nest is built for each brood, and in northern areas the first clutch is usually placed in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen" title="Evergreen">evergreen</a> tree or shrub while later broods are placed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> trees.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_12-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> The American Robin does not shy away from nesting close to human habitation.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup>
A clutch consists of three to five light blue <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>, and is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubated</a> by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14&nbsp;days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" title="Altricial">altricial</a> chicks are naked and have their eyes closed for the first few days after hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-IWRC_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IWRC-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.
The chicks are fed worms, insects, and berries. Waste accumulation does not occur in the nest because adults collect and take it away. Chicks are fed, and then raise tails for elimination of waste, a solid white clump that is collected by a parent prior to flying off. All chicks in the brood leave the nest within two days of each other.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_12-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Even after leaving the nest, the juveniles will follow their parents around and beg food from them. Juveniles become capable of sustained flight two weeks after fledging.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_12-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
The adult male and female both are active in protecting and feeding the fledged chicks until they learn to forage on their own. The adult Robin gives alarm calls and dive-bombs predators, including domestic cats, dogs and humans that come near the young birds. The fledglings are able to fly short distances after leaving the nest. The wings of juvenile birds develop rapidly, and it only takes a couple of weeks for them to become proficient at flying. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage" title="Camouflage">cryptically colored</a> young birds perch in bushes or trees for protection from predators.
Bird banders have found that only 25% of young Robins survive the first year.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_12-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> The longest known lifespan in the wild of an American Robin is 14&nbsp;years; the average lifespan is about 2&nbsp;years.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_12-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
The male American Robin, as with many thrushes, has a complex and almost continuous song. Its song is commonly described as a <i>cheerily</i> carol, made up of discrete units, often repeated, and spliced together into a string with brief pauses in between.<sup id="cite_ref-Bull87_22-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bull87-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> The song varies regionally, and its style varies by time of day. The song period is from early March in California to late July or early August; some birds, particularly in the east, sing occasionally into September or later. The American Robin is often among the first songbirds singing as dawn rises or hours before, and last as evening sets in. It usually sings from a high perch in a tree.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_12-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> The song of <i>T. m. confinis</i> is weaker than that of the nominate subspecies, and lacks any clear notes.<sup id="cite_ref-Clement_7-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Clement-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
In addition to its song, the American Robin has a number of calls used for communicating specific information. When a ground predator approaches but does not directly threaten, Robins will make a <i>PEEK!! tut tut tut tut...</i> warning call, often preceded by an explosive <i>seeech each-each-each</i>. When a nest or Robin is being directly threatened, another <i>he-he-he-he</i> call is used, which sounds like a horse's whinny. Even during nesting season, when Robins exhibit mostly competitive and territorial behavior, they may still band together to drive away a predator.<sup id="cite_ref-Clement_7-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Clement-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
