<i>Fuligula affinis</i> <small>Eyton, 1838</small>
The <b>Lesser Scaup</b> (<i>Aythya affinis</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_duck" title="Diving duck">diving duck</a> that migrates south as far as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> in winter. It is colloquially known as the <b>Little Bluebill</b> or <b>Broadbill</b> because of its distinctive blue bill. The origin of the name scaup may stem from the bird's preference for feeding on scalp - the Scottish word for clams, oysters, and mussels, however, some give it credit to the female's discordant scaup call as the name's source.<sup id="cite_ref-du_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-du-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> It is apparently a very close relative of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holarctic" title="Holarctic">Holarctic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Scaup" title="Greater Scaup">Greater Scaup</a> or "bluebill" (<i>A. marila</i>), with which it forms a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superspecies" title="Superspecies">superspecies</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Adults are 38–48 cm (15–19 in) long, 41.7–43 cm (16.4–17 in) on average. The species can weigh 454–1,089 g (1.00–2.40 lb); males weigh 820&nbsp;g (1.8&nbsp;lb) on average and weigh noticeably less, at 730&nbsp;g (1.6&nbsp;lb) on average.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Wing lengths (not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingspan" title="Wingspan">wingspans</a>) are about 7.5–7.9 in (19–20 cm) in males and 7.3–7.8 in (19–20 cm) in females; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is about 1.4–1.5 in (3.6–3.8 cm) long, and the bill 1.4–1.7 in (3.6–4.3 cm).<sup id="cite_ref-mcdu879208_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mcdu879208-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The wingspan is 68–78 cm (27–31 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The adult males (drakes) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_plumage" title="Alternate plumage" class="mw-redirect">alternate plumage</a> have a black, effervescent head and a small tuft at the hindcrown, a black breast, a whitish-grey back and wings with darker <a href="/w/index.php?title=Vermiculation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Vermiculation (page does not exist)">vermiculations</a> and black outer and greyish-brown inner primary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remiges" title="Remiges" class="mw-redirect">remiges</a>. The underparts are white with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_(color)" title="Olive (color)">olive</a> vermiculations on the flanks, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectrices" title="Rectrices" class="mw-redirect">rectrices</a> and tail coverts are black. Adult females (hens) have a white band at the base of the bill, often a lighter ear region, and are otherwise dark brown all over, shading to white on the mid-belly. Drakes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_plumage" title="Eclipse plumage" class="mw-redirect">eclipse plumage</a> look similar, but with a very dark head and breast, little or no white on the head and usually some greyish vermiculations on the wings. Immature birds resemble the adult females, but are duller and have hardly any white at the bill base. Both sexes have white secondary remiges, a blue-grey bill with a black "nail" at the tip and grey feet; the drakes have a bright yellow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" title="Iris (anatomy)">iris</a>, while that of females is orange or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_(colour)" title="Amber (colour)" class="mw-redirect">amber</a> and that of immatures is brown. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_feather" title="Down feather">Downy</a> hatchlings look much like those of related species, with dark brown upperparts and pale <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buff_(color)" title="Buff (color)" class="mw-redirect">buff</a> underparts, chin, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercilium" title="Supercilium">supercilium</a> and back spots.<sup id="cite_ref-mcdu879208_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mcdu879208-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
These birds are not very vocal, at least compared to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dabbling_duck" title="Dabbling duck" class="mw-redirect">dabbling ducks</a>. Hens give the namesake discordant <i>scaup, scaup</i> call; in courtship drakes produce weak whistles. Hens vocalize more often than those of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Scaup" title="Greater Scaup">Greater Scaup</a> – particularly during flight –, but their call is weaker, a guttural <i>brrtt, brrtt</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>

Lesser Scaup are often hard to distinguish from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Scaup" title="Greater Scaup">Greater Scaup</a> when direct comparison is not possible, but in North America a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aythya" title="Aythya">scaup</a> flock will often have both species present. Females, juveniles and drakes in eclipse plumage are hard to identify; there is considerable overlap in length between the two species, but Greater Scaup are usually noticeably more bulky. Lesser Scaup females and immatures tend to have less white around the bill, but this too varies considerably between individual birds. The bill may give a hint; in the Lesser Scaup it has a stronger curve on the upperside than in the Greater, resulting in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal" title="Distal" class="mw-redirect">distal</a> part that looks somewhat flattened and wide in the Lesser Scaup – hence the vernacular name "broadbill". If the birds fly, the most tell-tale sign is the white secondary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remiges" title="Remiges" class="mw-redirect">remiges</a>, whereas in the Greater Scaup the white extends on the primary remiges also, i.e. far towards the wingtip.<sup id="cite_ref-mcdu879208_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mcdu879208-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Lesser Scaup females show the characteristic darker iris (bright yellow in Greater Scaup males and females) at closer distances. Lesser Scaup drakes in nuptial plumage are often said to be recognizable by the purple instead of green sheen of the head and a darker back. But this is unreliable because it varies according to light conditions, and these birds are often too far away from the observer to make out any sheen at all. The best trait – if the primary remiges are not visible – is the shape of the head: in the Greater Scaup drake, the forehead is usually quite massive, whereas the nape presents a smooth shallow curve and may appear almost straightly sloping. The Lesser Scaup drake presents the opposite shape, with a less bulging forehead and a nape that looks strongly curved or even angular due to the small crest. When the birds raise their heads, these differences are most easy to spot, and after observing the two species in direct comparison it usually becomes easy to recognize. In fact, in alternate plumage the Lesser Scaup drake may appear identical in shape and size to a drake of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-necked_Duck" title="Ring-necked Duck">Ring-necked Duck</a> (<i>A. collaris</i>); the black back and wings of that species are hard to confuse with the light ones of the Lesser Scaup male though.<sup id="cite_ref-mcdu879208_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mcdu879208-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Particularly in the case of vagrant birds in Europe, the identification is complicated by similar-looking <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aythya" title="Aythya">Aythya</a></i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybrids</a>. Except for hybrids between the two scaup species, the most reliable mark is the black bill-tip of hybrids, whereas in the scaups only the very point ("nail") of the bill is black. This is even recognizable at considerable range, as the scaups' bills appear uniformly grey from a distance, whereas those of hybrids look two-colored. European hybrids typically involve the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tufted_Duck" title="Tufted Duck">Tufted Duck</a> (<i>A. fuligula</i>), yielding offspring that have a small nape crest unlike any European <i>Aythya</i> species. Female and immature hybrids typically lack the white bill base, except in those between Lesser Scaup and Ring-necked Duck, where the white extends to the eye region. But especially with juveniles, the bi-colored bill of hybrids is most diagnostic. Hybrid combinations that are known from the wild and resemble the Lesser Scaup are:
In theory, each and every <i>Aythya</i> species is able to produce potentially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile" title="Fertile" class="mw-redirect">fertile</a> hybrids with any other, though due to their different ranges and behavioral cues given during courtship most of these hybrids are only known from birds kept in captivity without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific" title="Conspecific" class="mw-redirect">conspecific</a> mates.<sup id="cite_ref-Madge_1987_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge_1987-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>

Notable breeding concentrations, with more than half a million birds at the height of the season, can be found in Alaska, in the woodlands of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie_River" title="McKenzie River">McKenzie River</a> valley and on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Crow_Flats" title="Old Crow Flats">Old Crow Flats</a>. These birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> south (mostly via the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Flyway" title="Central Flyway">Central</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Flyway" title="Mississippi Flyway">Mississippi Flyways</a>) when the young are fledged and return in early spring, usually arriving on the breeding ground in May. Lesser Scaup typically travel in flocks of 25-50 birds and winter mainly on lakes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River" title="River">rivers</a> and sheltered coastal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon" title="Lagoon">lagoons</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay" title="Bay">bays</a> between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">US</a>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canadian</a> border and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies" title="West Indies" class="mw-redirect">West Indies</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. Wintering Lesser Scaup are typically found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater" title="Freshwater" class="mw-redirect">freshwater</a> or slightly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brackish" title="Brackish" class="mw-redirect">brackish</a> habitat and unlike <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Scaup" title="Greater Scaup">Greater Scaup</a> rarely are seen offshore when unfrozen freshwater habitat is available. They may even spend the winter on lakes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park" title="Park">parks</a>, as long as they are not harassed, and will occur even on smallish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> islands such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Cayman" title="Grand Cayman">Grand Cayman</a>.

In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, flocks are present from July on, but only really numerous after September. They move north again in April and May. In the extreme southeast and southwest of the breeding range – the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> region of the northwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">USA</a> and the southern Great Lakes – Lesser Scaup are present all-year; it is not clear whether the breeding birds are replaced by migrants from the far north in winter, or whether the local populations do not migrate, or whether both local and migrant birds are found there in winter.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
They are rarely – but apparently increasingly often – seen as vagrants in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The first documented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> record was a first-winter male at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasewater" title="Chasewater">Chasewater</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire" title="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> in 1987<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> but by 2006, over 60 had been recorded, with an average of 2 per year.

Vagrant Lesser Scaup have also been recorded on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands" title="Hawaiian Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, possibly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" title="China">China</a>, and – for the first time on 18 January 2000 – in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianas" title="Marianas" class="mw-redirect">Marianas</a>, as well as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surinam" title="Surinam" class="mw-redirect">Surinam</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> (in winter), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> (in summer).<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
Lesser Scaup forage mainly by sifting through the bottom mud, usually after diving and swimming underwater, occasionally by dabbling without diving. They mainly eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusk" title="Mollusk" class="mw-redirect">mollusks</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussel" title="Mussel">mussels</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clam" title="Clam">clams</a>, as well as seeds and other parts of aquatic plants like sedges and bulrushes (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyperaceae" title="Cyperaceae">Cyperaceae</a>), "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondweed" title="Pondweed">pondweeds</a>", <a href="/w/index.php?title=Widgeon-grass&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Widgeon-grass (page does not exist)">Widgeon-grass</a> (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruppia_cirrhosa" title="Ruppia cirrhosa">Ruppia cirrhosa</a></i>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Celery" title="Wild Celery" class="mw-redirect">Wild Celery</a> (<i>Vallisneria americana</i>) or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_rice" title="Wild rice">wild rice</a> (<i>Zizania</i>). In winter, but less so in summer, other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_animal" title="Aquatic animal">aquatic</a> animals – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustacean</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insect</a> and their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva" title="Larva">larvae</a> and small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fishes</a> – form an important part of their diet. It has been reported that both the Lesser and the Greater Scaup have shifted their traditional migration routes to take advantage of the presence of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Mussel" title="Zebra Mussel" class="mw-redirect">Zebra Mussel</a> (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Erie" title="Lake Erie">Lake Erie</a>, which was accidentally introduced in the 1980s and has multiplied enormously. This may pose a risk to these birds because zebra mussels are efficient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_feeder" title="Filter feeder">filter feeders</a> and so accumulate environmental contaminants rapidly.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
They nest in a sheltered location on the ground near water, usually among thick vegetation such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyperaceae" title="Cyperaceae">sedges and bulrushes</a>, sometimes in small loose groups and not rarely next to colonies of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gulls</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">terns</a>; several females may deposit eggs in a single nest. The drakes court the hens in the winter quarters; pairs form shortly before and during the spring migration. When nesting starts, the males aggregate while they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moult" title="Moult" class="mw-redirect">moult</a> into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_plumage" title="Eclipse plumage" class="mw-redirect">eclipse plumage</a>, leaving the task of incubation and raising the young to the females alone.<sup id="cite_ref-Madge_1987_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Madge_1987-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
The nest is a shallow depression scraped in the ground and lined with plants and some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_feather" title="Down feather">down feathers</a>. Breeding begins in May, but most birds nest only in June, later than usual for North American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfowl" title="Waterfowl">waterfowl</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)" title="Clutch (eggs)">clutch</a> numbers about 9-11 eggs on average; up to 26 eggs have been found in a single nest, but such high numbers are from more than one female. Incubation is by the female only and lasts around 3 weeks. The young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> some 45–50 days after hatching and soon thereafter the birds migrate to winter quarters already. Lesser Scaup become sexually mature in their first or second summer. The oldest known individual reached an age of over 18 years.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
Before the start of the population decline (see <a href="#Conservation_status">below</a>), about 57% of the Lesser Scaup nests failed each breeding season because the female was killed or the eggs were eaten or destroyed. The average brood size of nests where eggs hatched successfully was 8.33 hatchlings.<sup id="cite_ref-carboneras1992_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-carboneras1992-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
Although the Lesser Scaup has the largest population of any species of diving duck in North America, their population has been steadily declining since the mid-1980s, and reached an all-time low in the early 20th century. During <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeding_bird_survey" title="Breeding bird survey">breeding bird surveys</a>, Lesser and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Scaup" title="Greater Scaup">Greater Scaup</a> are counted together due to the impossibility of identifying the species unequivocally when large numbers of birds are involved. Lesser Scaup are thought to comprise slightly less than nine-tenths of the scaup population of North America. In the 1970s, the Lesser Scaup population was estimated at 6.9 million birds on average; in the 1990s it had declined to about half that number, and by the late 2000s it is estimated at 3 million individuals or less. Due to the wide breeding range and the fact that the rate of decline, though remarkable, is still not threatening in respect to the enormous overall numbers, the Lesser Scaup is classified as a Species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern" title="Least Concern">Least Concern</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>. An increase of the decline is liable to result in an uplisting to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Threatened" title="Near Threatened">Near Threatened</a> or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species" title="Vulnerable species">Vulnerable</a> status.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
The causes for this stark – though not threatening, as of yet – decline remain unknown. There are indications that the breeding success is decreasing, but why this is so remains puzzling. On one hand, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction">habitat destruction</a>, especially in the wintering regions, has certainly increased since the early-mid 20th century. On the other hand, the narrow time frame in which Lesser Scaup breed and raise their young may be tied to some specific ecological conditions – such as abundance of key food items – which shifted winterwards due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, without the ducks being able to adapt. In this regard, it is alternatively or additionally possible that Great Scaup, which may be increasing in numbers, is putting the Lesser Scaup under increasingly severe competition.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
However, it seems that Greater Scaup eats larger food items on average,<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> and the species are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatric" title="Sympatric" class="mw-redirect">sympatric</a> in part of their range and presumably have been for millennium without any problems due to competition. The experience of the past as well as the reproduction rate – even if this is declining – suggests that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting" title="Hunting">hunting</a> has no major impact on Lesser Scaup populations at present either. Also, the breeding habitat is mainly in regions little-used by humans; habitat destruction on the breeding grounds is also not considered to be problematic.&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref-carboneras1992_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-carboneras1992-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
