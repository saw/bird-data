The <b>Burrowing Owl</b> (<i>Athene cunicularia</i>) is a tiny but long-legged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_owl" title="True owl">owl</a> found throughout open landscapes of North and South America. Burrowing Owls can be found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland" title="Grassland">grasslands</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangeland" title="Rangeland">rangelands</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> areas, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert" title="Desert">deserts</a>, or any other open dry area with low vegetation.<sup id="cite_ref-lewis2005_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-lewis2005-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> They nest and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird#Resting_and_roosting" title="Bird">roost</a> in burrows, such as those excavated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_dog" title="Prairie dog">prairie dogs</a> (<i>Cynomys</i> spp.). Unlike most owls, Burrowing Owls are often active during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnality" title="Diurnality">day</a>, although they tend to avoid the midday heat. But like many other kinds of owls, Burrowing Owls do most of their hunting from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular" title="Crepuscular">dusk</a> until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn" title="Dawn">dawn</a>, when they can use their night vision and hearing to their advantage.
Burrowing Owls have bright yellow eyes; their beaks can be dark yellow or gray depending on the subspecies. They lack ear tufts and have a flattened facial disc. The owls have prominent white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercilium" title="Supercilium">eyebrows</a> and a white "chin" patch which they expand and display during certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology" title="Ethology">behaviors</a>, such as a bobbing of the head when agitated.
Adults have brown heads and wings with white spotting. The chest and abdomen are white with variable brown spotting or barring, also depending on the subspecies. Juvenile owls are similar in appearance, but they lack most of the white spotting above and brown barring below. The juveniles have a buff bar across the upper wing and their breast may be buff-colored rather than white. Burrowing Owls of all ages have grayish legs longer than other owls.
Males and females are similar in size and appearance, and display little sexual dimorphism. Females tend to be heavier, but males tend to have longer linear measurements (wing length, tail length, etc.). Adult males appear lighter in color than females because they spend more time outside the burrow during daylight, and their feathers become "sun-bleached". The burrowing owl measures 19–28 cm (7.5–11 in) long, spans 50.8–61 cm (20.0–24 in) across the wings and weighs 140–240 g (4.9–8.5 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> As a size comparison, an average adult is slightly larger than an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Robin" title="American Robin">American Robin</a> (<i>Turdus migratorius</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-lewis2005_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-lewis2005-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Burrowing Owl is sometimes separated in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic" title="Monotypic" class="mw-redirect">monotypic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><b>Speotyto</b></i>.

On the other hand, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteology" title="Osteology">osteology</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequence" title="DNA sequence" class="mw-redirect">DNA sequence</a> data suggests that the Burrowing Owl is just a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_animal" title="Terrestrial animal">terrestrial</a> version of the <i>Athene</i> little owls, and it is today placed in that genus by most authorities.
A considerable number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> have been described, but they differ little in appearance and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy" title="Taxonomy">taxonomy</a> of several needs to be validated.<sup id="cite_ref-holtetal1999_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-holtetal1999-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Most subspecies are found in/near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a> and in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilles" title="Antilles">Antilles</a>. Only <i>A. c. hypugaea</i> and <i>A. c. floridana</i> are found in the United States. Although distinct from each other, the relationship of the Floridian subspecies to (and its distinctness from) the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> birds is not quite clear:<sup id="cite_ref-korfantaetal2005_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-korfantaetal2005-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronospecies" title="Chronospecies">paleosubspecies</a>, <i>A. c. providentiae</i>, has been described from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil" title="Fossil">fossil</a> remains from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene" title="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> of the Bahamas. How these birds relate to the extant <i>A. c. floridana</i> – that is, whether they were among the ancestors of that subspecies, or whether they represented a more distant lineage that completely disappeared later – is unknown.
In addition, prehistoric fossils of similar owls have been recovered from many islands in the Caribbean (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbuda" title="Barbuda">Barbuda</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands" title="Cayman Islands">Cayman Islands</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona,_Puerto_Rico" title="Mona, Puerto Rico" class="mw-redirect">Mona Island</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>). These birds became extinct towards the end of the Pleistocene, probably because of ecological and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level" title="Sea level">sea level</a> changes at the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation" title="Quaternary glaciation">last ice age</a> rather than human activity. These fossil owls differed in size from present-day Burrowing Owls, and their relationship to the modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon" title="Taxon">taxon</a> has not been resolved.

Before European colonization, Burrowing Owls probably inhabited every suitable area of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a>, but in North America they have experienced some restrictions in distribution since. In parts of South America they are expanding their range with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>.
They range from the southern portions of the western Canadian provinces through southern Mexico and western Central America. They are also found in Florida and many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> islands. In South America, they are patchy in the northwest and through the Andes, but widely distributed from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonia" title="Patagonia">Patagonia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tierra_del_Fuego" title="Tierra del Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a>. Burrowing Owls are year-round residents in most of their range. Birds that breed in Canada and the northern USA usually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> south to Mexico and southern USA during winter months.
This species can live for at least 9 years in the wild and over 10 years in captivity.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> They are often killed by vehicles when crossing roads, and have many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation" title="Predation">natural enemies</a>, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Badger" title="American Badger" class="mw-redirect">badgers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote" title="Coyote">coyotes</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake" title="Snake">snakes</a>.

When hunting, they wait on a perch until they spot prey. Then, they swoop down on prey or fly up to catch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> in flight. Sometimes, they chase prey on foot across the ground. The highly variable diet includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> and small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a>, which make up roughly one-third and two-thirds of the diet, respectively. Burrowing Owls mainly eat large insects and small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent" title="Rodent">rodents</a>. Although Burrowing Owls often live close to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_squirrel" title="Ground squirrel">ground squirrels</a> (Marmotini), they rarely prey upon them.
Rodent prey is usually dominated by locally superabundant species, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicate_Vesper_Mouse" title="Delicate Vesper Mouse" class="mw-redirect">Delicate Vesper Mouse</a> (<i>Calomys tener</i>) in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>. Among squamates and amphibians, small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard" title="Lizard">lizards</a> like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_house_gecko" title="Tropical house gecko">Tropical house gecko</a> (<i>Hemidactylus mabouia</i>), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toad" title="Toad">toads</a> predominate. Generally, most vertebrate prey is in the weight class of several grams per individual.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The largest prey are usually birds, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eared_Dove" title="Eared Dove">Eared Doves</a> (<i>Zenaida auriculata</i>) which may weigh almost as much as a Burrowing Owl.<sup id="cite_ref-mottajunior2006_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mottajunior2006-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> When food stressed or nesting in close proximity, adult Burrowing Owls will sometimes capture owlets from other nests to cannibalize or feed to their own young.
Regarding invertebrates, the Burrowing Owl seems less of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalist_and_specialist_species" title="Generalist and specialist species">generalist</a>. It is extremely fond of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite" title="Termite">termites</a> such as Termitidae, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthoptera" title="Orthoptera">Orthoptera</a> such as Conocephalinae and Copiphorinae <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tettigoniidae" title="Tettigoniidae">katydids</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_cricket" title="Jerusalem cricket">Jerusalem crickets</a> (Stenopelmatidae) and true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(insect)" title="Cricket (insect)">crickets</a> (Gryllidae). <i>Bothynus</i> and <i>Dichotomius anaglypticus</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarabaeidae" title="Scarabaeidae">scarab beetles</a> (Scarabaeidae) were eaten far more often than even closely related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> by many Burrowing Owls across central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(state)" title="São Paulo (state)">São Paulo</a> (Brazil). Similarly, it was noted that among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion" title="Scorpion">scorpions</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothriuridae" title="Bothriuridae">Bothriuridae</a> were much preferred, among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a> Lycosidae (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_spider" title="Wolf spider">wolf spiders</a>), and among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millipede" title="Millipede">millipedes</a> (Diplopoda) certain <a href="/w/index.php?title=Diplocheta_(millipedes)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Diplocheta (millipedes) (page does not exist)">Diplocheta</a>. Small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_beetle" title="Ground beetle">ground beetles</a> (Carabidae) are eaten in quantity, while larger ones are much less popular as Burrowing Owl food, perhaps due to the vigorous defense the large species can put up.<sup id="cite_ref-mottajunior2006_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mottajunior2006-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Burrowing owls are also known to place the fecal matter of large herbivorous mammals around the outside of their burrows to attract dung beatles which are used to provide a steady source of food for the owls.
Unlike other owls, they also eat fruits and seeds, especially the fruit of tasajillo (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindropuntia_leptocaulis" title="Cylindropuntia leptocaulis">Cylindropuntia leptocaulis</a></i>) and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia" title="Opuntia">prickly pear</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindropuntia" title="Cylindropuntia">cholla</a> cacti. On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarion_Island" title="Clarion Island">Clarion Island</a>, where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammalian</a> prey is lacking, they feed essentially on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(insect)" title="Cricket (insect)">crickets</a> and prickly pear fruit, adding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clari%C3%B3n_Wren" title="Clarión Wren">Clarión Wrens</a> (<i>Troglodytes tanneri</i>) and young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mourning_Dove" title="Mourning Dove">Mourning Doves</a> (<i>Zenaida macroura clarionensis</i>) on occasion.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
The nesting season begins in late March or April in North America. Burrowing Owls are usually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy" title="Monogamy">monogamous</a>, but occasionally a male will have two mates.<sup id="cite_ref-lewis2005_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-lewis2005-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Pairs of owls will sometimes nest in loose colonies. Their typical breeding habitat is open grassland or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie" title="Prairie">prairie</a>, but they can occasionally adapt to other open areas like airports, golf courses, and agricultural fields. Burrowing Owls are slightly tolerant of human presence, often nesting near roads, farms, homes, and regularly maintained irrigation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal" title="Canal">canals</a>.
The owls <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> in an underground burrow, hence the name Burrowing Owl. If burrows are unavailable and the soil is not hard or rocky, the owls may excavate their own. Burrowing Owls will also nest in shallow, underground, man-made structures that have easy access to the surface.
During the nesting season, Burrowing Owls will collect a wide variety of materials to line their nest, some of which are left around the entrance to the burrow. The most common material is mammal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces" title="Feces">dung</a>, usually from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle" title="Cattle">cattle</a>. At one time it was thought that the dung helped to mask the scent of the juvenile owls, but researchers now believe the dung helps to control the microclimate inside the burrow and to attract insects, which the owls may eat.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
The female will lay an egg every 1 or 2 days until she has completed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)" title="Clutch (eggs)">clutch</a>, which can consist of 4–12 eggs (usually 9). She will then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubate</a> the eggs for three to four weeks while the male brings her food. After the eggs hatch, both parents will feed the chicks. Four weeks after hatching, the chicks can make short flights and begin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">leaving</a> the nest burrow. The parents will still help feed the chicks for 1 to 3 months. While most of the eggs will hatch, only 4–5 chicks usually survive to leave the nest.
Site fidelity rates appear to vary among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population" title="Population">populations</a>. In some locations, owls will frequently reuse a nest several years in a row. Owls in migratory northern populations are less likely to return to the same burrow every year. Also, as with many other birds, the female owls are more likely to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_dispersal" title="Biological dispersal">disperse</a> to a different site than are male owls.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Burrowing Owl is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species" title="Endangered species">endangered</a> in Canada,<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_species" title="Threatened species">threatened</a> in Mexico, and a species of special concern in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> and most of the western USA. It is a state endangered species in Colorado. It is common and widespread in open regions of many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neotropic_ecozone" title="Neotropic ecozone">Neotropical</a> countries, where they sometimes even inhabit fields and parks in cities.

The major reasons for declining populations in North America are control programs for prairie dogs and loss of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a>. Burrowing Owls readily inhabit some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment" title="Human impact on the environment">anthropogenic</a> landscapes, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport" title="Airport">airport</a> grasslands or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course" title="Golf course">golf courses</a>, and are known to take advantage of artificial nest sites (plastic burrows with tubing for the entrance) and perches.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Genetic analysis of the two North American subspecies indicates that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding" title="Inbreeding">inbreeding</a> is not a problem within those populations.<sup id="cite_ref-korfantaetal2005_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-korfantaetal2005-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
Where the presence of Burrowing Owls conflicts with development interests, a passive relocation technique has been applied successfully: rather than capturing the birds and transporting them to a new site (which may be stressful and prone to failure), the owls are half-coerced, half-enticed to move on their own accord. The preparations need to start several months prior to the anticipated disturbance with observing the owl colony and noting especially their local movements and site preferences. After choosing a location nearby that has suitable ground and provides good Burrowing Owl breeding habitat, this new site is enhanced by adding burrows, perches, etc. Once the owls have accustomed to the changes and are found to be interested in the location – if any possible, this should be at the onset of spring, before the breeding season starts – they are prevented from entering the old burrows. A simple one-way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapdoor" title="Trapdoor">trapdoor</a> design has been described that is placed over the burrow for this purpose.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> If everything has been correctly prepared, the owl colony will move over to the new site in the course of a few nights at most. It will need to be monitored occasionally for the following months or until the major human construction nearby has ended.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup>
