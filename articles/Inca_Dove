Despite being named after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire" title="Inca Empire">Inca Empire</a>, this species does not occur in any of the lands that constituted that region. Inca Doves are common to abundant within their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)" title="Range (biology)">range</a> and they are expanding their range north and south.
Inca Doves reach a length of 16.5–23 cm (6.5–9.1 in) and weigh 30–58 g (1.1–2.0 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> They are slender, with a gray-brown body covered in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">feathers</a> that resemble a scaled pattern. The tail is long and square, edged with white feathers that may flare out in flight. In flight, the underwing is reddish, like other ground doves, and on takeoff, the wings produce a distinctive, quiet rattling noise.
This is a terrestrial species which occurs in flocks in open areas including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrubland" title="Scrubland" class="mw-redirect">scrub</a> and cultivation. It will feed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area" title="Urban area">urban</a> areas, eating grass seeds and taking advantage of the ready availability of water from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural" title="Agricultural" class="mw-redirect">agricultural</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburban" title="Suburban" class="mw-redirect">suburban</a> irrigation. The song, a forceful cooing rendered variously as "cowl-coo" or "POO-pup", may be given from a tree, wire, or other open, high perch such as a television aerial.
During winter, they roost in communal huddles in a pyramid formation that helps them conserve heat. These pyramids can contain up to 12 birds.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The flimsy twig <a href="/w/index.php?title=Brd_nest&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Brd nest (page does not exist)">nest</a> is built 1–8 m high in a tree, often a thorny species, and two white eggs are the normal clutch. The eggs are white because they do not need any camouflage, because they are well hidden or hard to get to.
