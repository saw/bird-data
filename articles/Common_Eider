The <b>Common Eider</b> (<i>Somateria mollissima</i>) is a large (50–71&nbsp;cm body length) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merginae" title="Merginae">sea-duck</a> that is distributed over the northern coasts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>. It breeds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> and some northern temperate regions, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">winters</a> somewhat farther south in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate" title="Temperate" class="mw-redirect">temperate</a> zones, when it can form large flocks on coastal waters. It can fly at speeds up to 113&nbsp;km/h (70&nbsp;mph).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The eider's nest is built close to the sea and is lined with the celebrated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiderdown" title="Eiderdown">eiderdown</a>, plucked from the female's breast. This soft and warm lining has long been harvested for filling pillows and quilts, but in more recent years has been largely replaced by down from domestic farm-geese and synthetic alternatives. Although eiderdown pillows or quilts are now a rarity, eiderdown harvesting continues and is sustainable, as it can be done after the ducklings leave the nest with no harm to the birds.
The Common Eider is both the largest of the four eider species and the largest duck found in Europe and in North America (except for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovy_Duck" title="Muscovy Duck">Muscovy Duck</a> which only reaches North America in a wild state in southernmost Texas). It measures 50 to 71 cm (20 to 28 in) in length, weighs 0.81 to 3.04 kg (1.8 to 6.7 lb) and spans 80–110 cm (31–43 in) across the wings.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> It is characterized by its bulky shape and large, wedge-shaped bill. The male is unmistakable, with its black and white plumage and green nape. The female is a brown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a>, but can still be readily distinguished from all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck" title="Duck">ducks</a>, except other eider species, on the basis of size and head shape. This duck's call is a pleasant "ah-ooo". The species is often readily approachable.
Drakes of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">European</a>, eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> and Asia/western North American races can be distinguished by minor differences in plumage and bill colour. Some authorities place the subspecies <i>v-nigra</i> as a separate species.
This species dives for crustaceans and molluscs, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussel" title="Mussel">mussels</a> being a favoured food. The eider will eat mussels by swallowing them whole; the shells are then crushed in their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gizzard" title="Gizzard">gizzard</a> and excreted. When eating a crab, the Eider will remove all of its claws and legs, and then eat the body in a similar fashion.
It is abundant, with populations of about 1.5-2 million birds in both North America and Europe, and also large but unknown numbers in eastern Siberia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handbook_of_the_Birds_of_the_World" title="Handbook of the Birds of the World">HBW</a>).
A particularly famous colony of eiders lives on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farne_Islands" title="Farne Islands">Farne Islands</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumberland" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>. These birds were the subject of one of the first ever bird protection laws, established by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuthbert_of_Lindisfarne" title="Cuthbert of Lindisfarne" class="mw-redirect">Saint Cuthbert</a> in the year 676. About 1,000 pairs still nest there every year. Because St. Cuthbert is the patron saint of Northumberland, it was natural that the eider should be chosen as the county's emblem bird; the birds are still often called <b>Cuddy's ducks</b> in the area, "Cuddy" being the familiar form of "Cuthbert".
In Canada's Hudson Bay, important eider die-offs were observed in the 1990s by local populations due to quickly changing ice flow patterns. The Canadian Wildlife Service has spent several years gathering up-to-date information on their populations, and preliminary results seem to show a population recovery.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The Common Eider is the object of a 2011 feature length documentary, <a href="/w/index.php?title=People_of_a_Feather&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="People of a Feather (page does not exist)">People of a Feather</a>, which studies the historical relationship between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanikiluaq" title="Sanikiluaq">Sanikiluaq</a> community and eiders, as well as various aspects of their ecology. The director/cinematographer/biologist <a href="/w/index.php?title=Joel_Heath&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Joel Heath (page does not exist)">Joel Heath</a> spent seven years on the project and writing biological articles on the Common Eider.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Common Eider is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEWA" title="AEWA" class="mw-redirect">AEWA</a>) applies.
Eiders are colonial breeders. They nest on coastal islands in colonies ranging in size of less than 100 to upwards of 10,000-15,000 individuals.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Female eiders frequently exhibit a high degree of natal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philopatry" title="Philopatry">philopatry</a>, where they return to breed on the same island where they were hatched. This can lead to a high degree of relatedness between individuals nesting on the same island, as well as the development of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship" title="Kinship">kin</a>-based female social structures.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> This relatedness has likely played a role in the evolution of co-operative breeding behaviours amongst eiders. Examples of these behaviours include laying eggs in the nests of related individuals <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A8che_(zoology)" title="Crèche (zoology)">crèching</a>, where female eiders team up and share the work of rearing ducklings.<sup id="cite_ref-Amnat_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Amnat-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
