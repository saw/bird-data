The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashy-faced_Owl" title="Ashy-faced Owl">Ashy-faced Owl</a> (<i>T. glaucops</i>) was for some time included in <i>T. alba</i>, and by some authors its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Antilles" title="Lesser Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a> populations <i>insularis</i> and <i>nigrescens</i> still are. The Barn Owls from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indopacific" title="Indopacific" class="mw-redirect">Indopacific</a> region are sometimes separated as <b>Eastern Barn-owl, Australian Barn-owl</b> or <b>Delicate Barn-owl</b> (<i>T. delicatula</i>). While this may be warranted, it is not clear between which races to draw the line between the two species. Also, some island subspecies are occasionally treated as distinct species. While all this may be warranted, such a move is generally eschewed pending further information on Barn Owl <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogeography" title="Phylogeography">phylogeography</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-bruce1999_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bruce1999-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Barn Owl is a pale, long-winged, long-legged owl with a short squarish tail. Generally a medium-sized owl, there is considerable size variation across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>. The Barn Owl measures about 25–50 cm (9.8–20 in) in overall length, with a wingspan of some 75–110 cm (30–43 in).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Adult body mass is also variable, ranging from 187 to 800 g (6.6 to 28 oz), with the owls closer to the tropics being generally smaller.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Tail shape is a way of distinguishing the Barn Owl from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_owl" title="True owl">true owls</a> when seen in flight, as are the wavering motions and the open dangling feathered legs. The light face with its heart shape and the black eyes give the flying bird an odd and startling appearance, like a flat mask with oversized oblique black eyeslits, the ridge of feathers above the bill somewhat resembling a nose.<sup id="cite_ref-bso9906_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bso9906-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
Its head and upper body typically vary between a light brown and a light colored and dark grey (especially on the forehead and back) feathers in most subspecies. Some are purer, richer brown instead, and all have fine black-and-white speckles except on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remiges" title="Remiges" class="mw-redirect">remiges</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectrices" title="Rectrices" class="mw-redirect">rectrices</a>, which are light brown with darker bands. The heart-shaped face is usually bright white, but in some subspecies it is browner. The underparts (including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsometatarsus" title="Tarsometatarsus">tarsometatarsus</a> feathers) vary from white to reddish buff among the subspecies, and are either mostly unpatterned or bear a varying amount of tiny blackish-brown speckles. It was found that at least in the continental European populations, females with more spotting are healthier on average. This does not hold true for European males by contrast, where the spotting varies according to subspecies. The bill varies from pale horn to dark buff, corresponding to the general plumage hue. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(eye)" title="Iris (eye)" class="mw-redirect">iris</a> is blackish brown. The toes, as the bill, vary in color; their color ranges from pinkish to dark pinkish-grey. The talons are black.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
On average, within any one population males tend to be less spotted on the underside than females. The latter are also larger, as is common for owls. A strong female <i>T. alba</i> of a large subspecies may weigh over 550 g (19.4&nbsp;oz), while males are typically about 10% lighter. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestling" title="Nestling" class="mw-redirect">Nestlings</a> are covered in white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_feather" title="Down feather">down</a> all over, but the heart-shaped facial disk is visible soon after hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-OwlPages_2006_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OwlPages_2006-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Contrary to popular belief, it does not hoot (such calls are made by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typical_owl" title="Typical owl" class="mw-redirect">typical owls</a>, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawny_Owl" title="Tawny Owl">Tawny Owl</a> or other <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strix_(genus)" title="Strix (genus)">Strix</a></i>). It instead produces the characteristic <i>shree</i> scream, ear-shattering at close range. Males in courtship give a shrill twitter. It can hiss like a snake to scare away intruders, and when captured or cornered, it throws itself on its back and flails with sharp-taloned feet, making for an effective defense. Also given in such situations is a rasp and a clicking snap, produced by the bill or possibly the tongue. It is most recognizable by its "mask-like" face.<sup id="cite_ref-bso9906_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bso9906-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
Across its vast range, the Barn Owl has formed many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>, but several are considered to be intergrades between more distinct populations today. Still, some 20–30 seem to be worthy of recognition as long as the species is not split up. They vary mainly in size and color, sometimes according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergmann%27s_Rule" title="Bergmann's Rule" class="mw-redirect">Bergmann's</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloger%27s_Rule" title="Gloger's Rule" class="mw-redirect">Gloger's Rules</a>, sometimes more unpredictably. This species ranges in colour from the almost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beige" title="Beige">beige</a>-and-white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominate_subspecies" title="Nominate subspecies" class="mw-redirect">nominate subspecies</a>, <i>erlangeri</i> and <i>niveicauda</i> to the nearly black-and-brown <i>contempta</i>:<sup id="cite_ref-bruce1999_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bruce1999-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
<i>Tyto alba</i> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal" title="Nocturnal" class="mw-redirect">nocturnal</a>, as is usual for owls, but it often becomes active shortly before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusk" title="Dusk">dusk</a> already and can sometimes be seen during the day, when it relocates from a sleeping place it does not like.
This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> of open country such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arable_land" title="Arable land">farmland</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland" title="Grassland">grassland</a> with some interspersed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland" title="Woodland">woodland</a>, usually below 2,000 m <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level" title="Above mean sea level">ASL</a> but occasionally as high as 3,000 m ASL in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics" title="Tropics">tropics</a>. This owl prefers to hunt along the edges of woods. It has an effortless wavering flight as it quarters pastures or similar hunting grounds. Like most owls, the Barn Owl flies silently; tiny serrations on the leading edges of its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">flight feathers</a> help to break up the flow of air over its wings, thereby reducing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence" title="Turbulence">turbulence</a> and the noise that accompanies it. The behaviour and ecological preferences may differ slightly even among neighboring subspecies, as shown in the case of the European <i>T. a. guttata</i> and <i>T. a. alba</i> which probably evolved, respectively, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric" title="Allopatric" class="mw-redirect">allopatric</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_refugia" title="Glacial refugia" class="mw-redirect">glacial refugia</a> in southeastern Europe, and in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula" title="Iberian Peninsula">Iberia</a> or southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
It hunts by flying low and slowly over an area of open ground, hovering over spots that conceal potential prey. They may also use fence posts or other lookouts to ambush prey. The Barn Owl feeds primarily on small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a>, particularly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent" title="Rodent">rodents</a>. Studies have shown that an individual Barn Owl may eat one or more rodents per night; a nesting pair and their young can eat more than 1,000 rodents per year. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up the single largest proportion of prey, no matter whether they are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muridae" title="Muridae">Muridae</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricetidae" title="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a><sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomyidae" title="Geomyidae" class="mw-redirect">Geomyidae</a> (pocket gophers). Such animals probably make up at least three-quarters of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">biomass</a> eaten by each and every <i>T. alba</i>, except in some island populations.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, the accidental introduction of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Vole" title="Bank Vole" class="mw-redirect">Bank Vole</a> in the 1950s has led to a major shift in the Barn Owl's diet: where their ranges overlap the vole is now by far the largest prey item.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup>
The diet is supplemented with local small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> and large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrate</a> life. A Barn Owl will eat anything it can subdue and that is more than a beakful, from small invertebrates weighing less than 0.05&nbsp;grams to birds weighing as much as the owl itself, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_Nothura" title="Spotted Nothura">Spotted Nothura</a> (<i>Nothura maculosa</i>). Small prey is usually torn into chunks and eaten completely with bones and all, while prey larger of about 100 g or more (such as baby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit" title="Rabbit">rabbits</a>, <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptomys" title="Cryptomys">Cryptomys</a></i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blesmol" title="Blesmol">blesmols</a> or <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otomys" title="Otomys">Otomys</a></i> vlei rats) is usually dismembered and the inedible parts discarded. Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, the Barn Owl does not eat domestic animals on any sort of regular basis; it might snatch a young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken" title="Chicken">chicken</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig" title="Guinea pig">guinea pig</a> once or twice in its life, if at all. Regionally, different foods outside of rodents are utilized as per availability. On bird-rich islands, a Barn Owl might contain some 15-20% birds in its diet, while in grassland it will gorge itself on swarming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite" title="Termite">termites</a>, or on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthoptera" title="Orthoptera">Orthoptera</a> such as <a href="/w/index.php?title=Copiphorinae&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Copiphorinae (page does not exist)">Copiphorinae</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katydid" title="Katydid" class="mw-redirect">katydids</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_cricket" title="Jerusalem cricket">Jerusalem crickets</a> (Stenopelmatidae) or true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(insect)" title="Cricket (insect)">crickets</a> (Gryllidae). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat" title="Bat">Bats</a> and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toad" title="Toad">toads</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamate" title="Squamate" class="mw-redirect">squamates</a> may as well make up a minor but conspicuous part of the prey; small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soricomorpha" title="Soricomorpha">Soricomorpha</a> like <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suncus" title="Suncus">Suncus</a></i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrew" title="Shrew">shrews</a> (which to a hunting barn owl probably look much like mice) may be secondary prey of major importance.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Barn Owl has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically for improved detection of sound position and distance, and it does not require sight to hunt. Hunting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal" title="Nocturnal" class="mw-redirect">nocturnally</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular" title="Crepuscular">crepuscularly</a>, it can target and dive down, penetrating its talons through snow, grass or brush to seize rodents with deadly accuracy. Compared to other owls of similar size, the Barn Owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Pound for pound, Barn Owls consume more rodents – often regarded as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism)" title="Pest (organism)">pests</a> by humans – than possibly any other creature. This makes the Barn Owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals to farmers. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage Barn Owl habitation by providing nest sites.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>
In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate" title="Temperate" class="mw-redirect">temperate</a> regions, the breeding season usually starts in late March to early April. Breeding can take place at any time prey is abundant, and in the warm parts of its range may occur at any time of the year. An increase in rodent populations will usually soon cause the local Barn Owls to begin nesting; thus, even in the cooler parts of its range two broods are often raised each year. The male entices as are often used. Occasionally, nesting takes place in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaft_mining" title="Shaft mining">mine shafts</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave" title="Cave">caves</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-ob0609_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ob0609-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> The female typically lays four–seven eggs. The male brings food to the nest as the female incubates the eggs and cares for chicks.<sup id="cite_ref-LPZBarnOwl_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LPZBarnOwl-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>
Barn Owl threat displays usually include hissing and bill-snapping as shown in "Three Barn Owls threatening an intruder".
Unusual for such a good-sized and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivorous" title="Carnivorous" class="mw-redirect">carnivorous</a> animal, the Barn Owl emphasizes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-selection" title="R-selection" class="mw-redirect">r-selection</a> (as does their prey). Most individuals manage to breed only once in their life, falling victim to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator" class="mw-redirect">predators</a> or accidents before being 2 years of age. While wild Barn Owls are thus decidedly short-lived, the actual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity" title="Longevity">longevity</a> of the species is much higher – captive individuals may reach 20 years of age or more. But occasionally, a wild bird reaches an advanced age, such as about a dozen years or more. The American record age for a wild Barn Owl was 11 years and a half, while a Dutch bird was noted to have reached an age of 17 years, 10 months. Another captive barn owl, in England, lived to be over 25 years old. Taking into account such extremely long-lived individuals, the average lifespan of the Barn Owl is about 4 years, and statistically two-thirds to three-quarters of all adults survive from one year to the next. But as noted above, the <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mortality" class="extiw" title="wikt:mortality">mortality</a> is not evenly distributed throughout the birds' life, and only one young in three manages to live to its first breeding attempt.<sup id="cite_ref-ob0609_22-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ob0609-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator" class="mw-redirect">Predators</a> of the Barn Owl include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_American_opossum" title="Large American opossum" class="mw-redirect">large American opossums</a> (<i>Didelphis</i>), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Raccoon" title="Common Raccoon" class="mw-redirect">Common Raccoon</a> (<i>Procyon lotor</i>), and similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivorous" title="Carnivorous" class="mw-redirect">carnivorous</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, as well as large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">raptors</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle" title="Eagle">eagles</a>, and other owls. Among the latter, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Horned_Owl" title="Great Horned Owl">Great Horned Owl</a> (<i>Bubo virginianus</i>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Eagle-owl" title="Eurasian Eagle-owl" class="mw-redirect">Eurasian Eagle-owl</a> (<i>B. bubo</i>) are noted predators of Barn Owls (though there is little evidence for predation on wild birds by Great Horned Owls).<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> Some also fall victim to large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake" title="Snake">snakes</a>, but the biggest threat are humans and their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet" title="Pet">pets</a>, in particular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_cat" title="House cat" class="mw-redirect">house</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_cat" title="Feral cat">feral cats</a>.
Barn Owls are relatively common throughout most of their range and not considered globally threatened. However, locally severe declines from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organochlorine" title="Organochlorine" class="mw-redirect">organochlorine</a> (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">DDT</a>) poisoning in the mid-20th century and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodenticide" title="Rodenticide">rodenticides</a> in the late 20th century have affected some populations. While the Barn Owl is prolific and able to recover from short-term population decreases, they are not as common in some places as they used to be. The most recent survey (1995-1997) put their British population at between 3,000 to 5,000 breeding pairs, out of an average of about 150,000 pairs (varying with rodent stocks) in the whole of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, for example. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">USA</a>, Barn Owls are listed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species" title="Endangered species">endangered species</a> in seven <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States" title="Midwestern United States">Midwestern states</a>, and in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Community" title="European Community" class="mw-redirect">European Community</a> they are considered a Species of European Concern.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup>
Common names such as "Demon Owl", "Death Owl" or "Ghost Owl" show that for long, rural populations in many places considered Barn Owls to be birds of evil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omen" title="Omen">omen</a>. Consequently, they were often persecuted by farmers, unaware of the benefit these birds bring. As late as 1975, hunting by fearful locals was limiting the population of <i>T. a. gracilirostris</i> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuerteventura" title="Fuerteventura">Fuerteventura</a>. In current times, rodenticide poisoning is the main threat for the Canary Barn-owl, which in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinijo_Archipelago" title="Chinijo Archipelago">Chinijo Archipelago</a> is on the verge of disappearance while on Fuerteventura only a few dozen pairs remain overall. There, the abandonment of much agricultural land and the subsequent decline of rodent pests seem to have decreased the owl's numbers even further. Only on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanzarote" title="Lanzarote">Lanzarote</a> does a somewhat larger number of these birds still seem to exist, but altogether this particular subspecies is precariously rare: Probably less than 300 and perhaps less than 200 birds still exist, and it is classified as <i>insuficientemente conocida</i> ("<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_deficient" title="Data deficient" class="mw-redirect">data deficient</a>") by the Spanish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_the_Natural,_Rural_and_Marine_Environment_(Spain)" title="Ministry of the Natural, Rural and Marine Environment (Spain)" class="mw-redirect">Ministry of Environment</a>. Similarly, the birds on the western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands" title="Canary Islands">Canary Islands</a> which are usually assigned to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominate_subspecies" title="Nominate subspecies" class="mw-redirect">nominate subspecies</a> (though this seems suspect on grounds of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography" title="Biogeography">biogeography</a>) have declined much, and here wanton destruction seems still to be significant. On Tenerife they seem to be not uncommon, while on the other islands, the situation looks about as bleak as on Fuerteventura. Due to the assignment to the nominate subspecies, which is common in mainland <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>, the western Canary Islands population is not classified as threatened.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup>
