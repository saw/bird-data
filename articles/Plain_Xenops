The <b>Plain Xenops</b> (<i>Xenops minutus</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> which breeds in moist lowland forests in the tropical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a> from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> south to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, northeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> and central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>.
It is a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South American</a> bird family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovenbird_(family)" title="Ovenbird (family)">Furnariidae</a>, a group in which many species build elaborate clay nests, giving rise to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> name for the family of "ovenbirds".
However, Plain Xenops simply places shredded plant fibres in a hole between 1.5 and 9&nbsp;m high in a decaying tree trunk or branch. The normal clutch is two white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>, incubated by both sexes. This species is a resident breeder in forest habitats.
The Plain Xenops is typically 12&nbsp;cm long, weighs 12&nbsp;g, and has a stubby wedge-shaped bill. The head is light brown with a buff supercilium and whitish malar stripe. The upperparts are brown, becoming rufous on the tail and rump, and there is a buff bar on the darker brown wings. The underparts are unstreaked pale olive brown. The sexes are similar, but young birds have dark brown throats. The lack of streaking is an obvious distinction from other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenops" title="Xenops">xenops</a> especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaked_Xenops" title="Streaked Xenops">Streaked Xenops</a>. It is also the only lowland species in the genus.
The Plain Xenops is often difficult to see as it forages for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, including the larvae of wood-boring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle" title="Beetle">beetles</a>, on bark, rotting stumps or bare twigs. It moves in all directions on the trunk like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treecreeper" title="Treecreeper">treecreeper</a>, but does not use its tail as a prop. It may be located by its sharp <i>cheet</i> call, or its song, a series of 5 or 6 trilled <i>fit fit fit f’ f’f f’</i> notes.
