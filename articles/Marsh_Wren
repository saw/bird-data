<i>Telmatodytes palustris</i>
The <b>Marsh Wren</b> (<i>Cistothorus palustris</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wren" title="Wren">wren</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a>. It is sometimes called <b>Long-billed Marsh Wren</b> to distinguish it from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedge_Wren" title="Sedge Wren">Sedge Wren</a>, also known as Short-billed Marsh Wren.
Adults have brown upperparts with a light brown belly and flanks and a white throat and breast. The back is black with white stripes. They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill.
The male's song is a loud gurgle used to declare ownership of territory; western males have a more varied repertoire.
Their breeding habitat is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a> with tall vegetation such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattail" title="Cattail" class="mw-redirect">cattails</a> across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. In the western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, some birds are permanent residents. Other birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to marshes and salt marshes in the southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.
These birds forage actively in vegetation, sometimes flying up to catch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> in flight. They mainly eat insects, also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail" title="Snail">snails</a>.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> is an oval lump attached to marsh vegetation, entered from the side. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)" title="Clutch (eggs)">clutch</a> is normally 4–6 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>, though the number can range from 3–10.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The male builds many unused nests in his territory; he may puncture the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> of other birds nesting nearby.
This bird is still common, although its numbers have declined with the loss of suitable wetland habitat. Wholesale draining of marshes will lead to local extinction. Still, this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> is widespread enough not to qualify as threatened according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>.
