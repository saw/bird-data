The <b>Least Grebe</b> (<i>Tachybaptus dominicus</i>), an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_bird" title="Aquatic bird" class="mw-redirect">aquatic bird</a>, is the smallest member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grebe" title="Grebe">grebe</a> family. It occurs in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a> from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">southwestern United States</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, and also on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago" title="Trinidad and Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas" title="The Bahamas">the Bahamas</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Antilles" title="Greater Antilles">Greater Antilles</a>.
The Least Grebe ranges in length from 21–27&nbsp;cm (roughly 8.25–10.5&nbsp;inches, depending on the subspecies) and in weight from 112–180&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram" title="Gram">g</a> (3.95–6.35&nbsp;oz).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Like all grebes, its legs are set far back on its body and it cannot walk well, though it is an excellent swimmer and diver. Small and plump, with a fairly short, sharp-pointed beak and bright yellow eyes, it typically appears quite dark all over.
The breeding adult is brownish grey above with a darker blackish crown and throat. It has a brownish chest and pale underparts. It shows a white wing patch in flight. Non-breeding birds are paler with a whitish throat, and immatures are paler and greyer than adults. Unlike all other members of its genus, it lacks any chestnut coloring on its neck.
There are five recognized subspecies of Least Grebe, separated principally by size and color.<sup id="cite_ref-Ogilvie32_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ogilvie32-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Its genus name, <i>Tachybaptus</i>, is a combination of two Greek words—<i>takhus</i> meaning fast and <i>baptos</i> meaning diving, or sinking under.<sup id="cite_ref-Ogilvie98_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ogilvie98-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The specific name <i>dominicus</i> refers to the Caribbean island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispaniola" title="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>, which was formerly known as Santo Domingo.<sup id="cite_ref-Ogilvie98_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ogilvie98-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> As its English name suggests, the Least Grebe is overall the smallest member of the grebe family. It is the only member of its genus found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a>; the four other members of the genus <i>Tachybaptus</i> reside in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World" title="Old World">Old World</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia" title="Australasia">Australasia</a>.
Least Grebes are found in a wide variety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland" title="Wetland">wetland</a> habitats, including freshwater ponds, lakes, and marshes, slow-flowing streams and rivers, roadside ditches, and mangrove swamps.<sup id="cite_ref-Ogilvie32_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ogilvie32-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Howell_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Howell-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> In general, they prefer bodies of water with significant amounts of vegetative cover, particularly along the edges; they will even use wetlands which are almost completely overgrown.<sup id="cite_ref-Ogilvie32_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ogilvie32-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> They may choose small, temporary bodies of water to breed, in an effort to avoid predation of their chicks by large fish.<sup id="cite_ref-Ogilvie34_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ogilvie34-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
For much of the year, Least Grebes are found singly or in pairs; however, when not breeding, they sometimes gather in flocks of 20 or more.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Least Grebe eats a variety of aquatic life, including small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_insect" title="Aquatic insect" class="mw-redirect">aquatic insects</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Stiles_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stiles-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Like all grebes, it pursues much of its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey" title="Prey" class="mw-redirect">prey</a> underwater. During active feeding bouts, it spends an average of 12.5 seconds beneath the surface on each dive, with surface pauses ranging from 2–24 seconds.<sup id="cite_ref-Jenni_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Jenni-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
Least Grebes breed throughout the year.<sup id="cite_ref-Stiles_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stiles-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Those in the tropics tend to breed during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainy_season" title="Rainy season" class="mw-redirect">rainy season</a>, while active nests have been found in every month of the year in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Ogilvie34_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ogilvie34-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Each pair builds a compact floating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation" title="Vegetation">vegetation</a>—typically a variety of aquatic weeds—which is anchored to rooted plants in still open water as deep as 1.5&nbsp;m (5&nbsp;ft). The female lays three to six white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>, though the damp nest material soon stains them with brown.<sup id="cite_ref-Stiles_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stiles-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Both adults incubate the eggs, which hatch after 21 days. The striped young are sometimes carried on the adult's back.
The breeding call has been likened to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse" title="Horse">horse</a> whinnying.
The Least Grebe is at risk from a number of predators, particularly early in life. Large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> species and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle" title="Turtle">turtles</a> are reported to take young grebes, and bird-eating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">raptors</a>, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_Falcon" title="Bat Falcon">Bat Falcon</a>, have been observed taking adult birds.<sup id="cite_ref-Ogilvie34_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ogilvie34-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
