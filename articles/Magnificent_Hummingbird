It is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic_taxon" title="Monotypic taxon">only member</a> of the genus <i><b>Eugenes</b></i>, although the northern, nominate subspecies <i>E. f. fulgens</i> has on occasion been separated from the larger, southern race of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a> and Panama, <i>E. f. spectabilis</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> as Rivoli's Hummingbird.

This large species can range from 11–14 cm (4.3–5.5 in) in length and can weigh from 6 to 10 g (0.21 to 0.35 oz), with males being typically a little larger than females.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Of the hummingbirds found in the United States, the Magnificent Hummingbird is one of the two largest species being rivaled only by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-throated_Hummingbird" title="Blue-throated Hummingbird" class="mw-redirect">Blue-throated Hummingbird</a>. In the southern reaches of its range, the Magnificent may co-exist with other hummingbird species of comparable or slightly larger size. The black bill is long and straight to slightly curved.

The adult male is green-bronze dorsally, becoming more bronzed on the black-tipped tail.
