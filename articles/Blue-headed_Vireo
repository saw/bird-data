The <b>Blue-headed Vireo</b> (<i>Vireo solitarius</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neotropical" title="Neotropical" class="mw-redirect">Neotropical</a> migrating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_bird" title="Song bird" class="mw-redirect">song bird</a> found in North and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>. There are currently two recognized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-species" title="Sub-species" class="mw-redirect">sub-species</a> that belong to the Blue-headed Vireo. It has a range that extends across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the eastern coast of the United-States, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and some of Central America. It prefers large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate" title="Temperate" class="mw-redirect">temperate</a> forests with a mix of evergreen trees and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> under growth.
As the name suggests, the Blue-headed Vireo is characterized by its blue-grey head and bold yellow wing bars. Both sexes are very similar in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> and size. Juveniles also have a similar plumage.
Populations of the Blue-headed Vireo have been steadily increasing since the 1970s<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> and has therefore been classified as a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern" title="Least Concern">Least Concern</a>" species in 2004.
The Blue–headed Vireo has similar plumage year round and does not drastically change its appearance during the breeding season. It can be characterized by its olive green upper body, two bold yellow wing bars down the edge of its wing, and a deep blue-grey <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(anatomy)" title="Crown (anatomy)">crown</a> from which it gets its name. The juvenile plumage of immature Blue-headed Vireos is not distinct but very similar to the adult plumage.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> While this bird’s appearance is similar to the closely related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassin%27s_Vireo" title="Cassin's Vireo">Cassin's Vireo</a> (<i>Vireo cassinii</i>), the Cassin's Vireo can be differentiated by its lighter yellow patches, a smaller, thinner bill, and a brownish-grey crown.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> There is little to no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> between males and females as both are similar in plumage colouration and size.<sup id="cite_ref-Hamilton_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hamilton-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Like most Vireos, the Blue-headed Vireo is a relatively small bird with a length of 126-148 millimetres (4.9-5.8&nbsp;in). The wingspan is usually found to be around 200-240 millimetres (7.9-9.4&nbsp;in) and their weight is typically 13-19&nbsp;grams (0.4-0.67&nbsp;oz). There are some subtle differences between the <i>V.s. solitarius</i> and <i>V.s. alticola</i> sub-species. <i>V.s. alticola</i>, the larger of the two sub-species, has a darker back with a larger wing length of 76-83.5 millimetres (3-3.3&nbsp;in) and a bill length of 11-12 millimetres (0.43-0.47&nbsp;in). Conversely, <i>V.s. solitarius</i> is slightly smaller with a wing length of 69.2-77.8 millimetres (2.7–3&nbsp;in), and a bill length of 8.9-11 millimetres (0.3-0.4&nbsp;in).<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The average lifespan of the Blue-headed Vireo in the wild has been measured to be approximately 7 years and 5 months.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Blue-headed Vireo is placed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vireo" title="Vireo">Vireo</a></i>, a group of small migrating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine_birds" title="Passerine birds" class="mw-redirect">passerine birds</a> that are characterized by their usually dull greenish colouring, and a simple, monotonous song. Members of this group are usually characterized by the presence or absence of eye-rings, eye-strips, and wing bars. There is no sexual dimorphism between sexes in this group.<sup id="cite_ref-Hamilton_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hamilton-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Originally considered its own species, in the 1950s, based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphological</a> data, the two Blue-headed Vireo sub-species were grouped with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumbeous_Vireo" title="Plumbeous Vireo">Plumbeous Vireo</a> (<i>Vireo plumbeus</i>) and the Cassin’s Vireo (<i>V. Cassinii</i>). This group of Vireos was collectively known as the “Solitary Vireo” (<i>Vireo solitarius</i>). This taxonomy prevailed until 1997 when new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular" title="Molecular" class="mw-redirect">molecular</a> data on the “Solitary Vireo” showed that the three birds were in fact distinct species. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy" title="Taxonomy">taxonomy</a> was then changed back and the Blue-headed Vireo was once again its own species.<sup id="cite_ref-Cicero_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cicero-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
There are two recognized subspecies of Blue-headed Vireo<sup id="cite_ref-Cicero_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cicero-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>:
Native to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, the Blue-headed Vireo enjoys a large breeding range that expands over an immense area of Canada and northern United States. The breeding range of <i>V.s. solitarius</i> expands from north eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta" title="Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario" title="Ontario">Ontario</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> and down to southern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. <i>V.s. alticola</i> has a distinct breeding range that includes western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> and then south, mainly in the Appalachian Mountains, to northern Georgia. At the end of the breeding season, the Blue-headed Vireo will migrate south to its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwintering" title="Overwintering">overwintering</a> area. <i>V.s. solitarius</i> has the longest migration of the two sub-species and inhabits an overwintering area that includes east and south Mexico to northern Central America. <i>V.s. alticola</i> migrates across a shorter distance to an area that expands from south-eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
During breeding, the Vireos prefer temperate forests that are found at higher elevations where it is cooler. Evergreen forests with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce" title="Spruce">spruce</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir" title="Fir">fir</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsuga" title="Tsuga">hemlock</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine" title="Pine">pine</a> with deciduous growth such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder" title="Alder">alder</a> shrubs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow" title="Willow">willow</a> shrubs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poplar" title="Poplar" class="mw-redirect">poplar</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch" title="Birch">birch</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple" title="Maple">maple</a> trees are the habitat of choice for the small bird.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> During the winter, Vireos inhabit woods of pines, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardwoods" title="Hardwoods" class="mw-redirect">hardwoods</a> and mixed trees. They are also found in coastal and flood plain swamps as well as low shrub thickets.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Year round, even during the breeding season, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density" title="Population density">population density</a> is somewhat low and spread out. Overwintering population densities are usually found to be lower than in the breeding season.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The density of the population ultimately depends on the type of forest being inhabited.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
During migration, Blue-headed vireos are often found to flock with groups of different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparrow" title="Sparrow">sparrow</a> species but never with members of its own species.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
When arriving to the breeding grounds in mid-April, many deciduous trees have not begun to leaf out, prompting the migrating Blue-headed Vireos to nest in the evergreen hemlock tree. Recently, however, some of the native habitat of the Blue-headed Vireo has been deteriorated by an invasive Asian insect, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemlock_woolly_adelgid" title="Hemlock woolly adelgid">Hemlock woolly adelgid</a> (<i>Adelges tsugae</i>). These <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_bugs" title="True bugs" class="mw-redirect">true bugs</a> feed on the evergreen hemlock trees which leave the migrating Vireos with fewer habitats to form breeding nests until the deciduous trees begin to leaf.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
The primary song of the Blue-headed Vireo is a simple, slow, monotonous tune that is often confused with the faster <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-eyed_Vireo" title="Red-eyed Vireo">Red-eyed Vireo</a> (<i>Vireo olivaceus</i>) song. The primary song is sung only by the males and usually only during the breeding season. The males become quite vocal during the breeding season, with the song frequency reaching its height prior to mating and then decreasing after copulation. Both sexes share a series of calls that are used in both defence of nests, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interspecies_competition" title="Interspecies competition" class="mw-redirect">interspecies competition</a>, and communication between breeding pairs while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraging" title="Foraging">foraging</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
When foraging during the breeding season, mating pairs will constantly communicate with each other using a series of high pitched chirping calls.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Morton_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Morton-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Blue-headed Vireos are mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivorous" title="Insectivorous" class="mw-redirect">insectivorous</a> birds but are also known to eat fleshy berries and fruit. They are equipped with short, strong <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bills</a> used for processing insect prey with a tough <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carapace" title="Carapace">carapace</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle" title="Beetle">beetles</a>. Usually, foraging will occur in the mid level of trees, a foraging Blue-headed Vireo will hop from branch to branch on the same or to an adjacent tree and will then fly towards its prey to capture it.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Typical prey consist mostly of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar" title="Caterpillar">caterpillars</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly" title="Butterfly">butterflies</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moths" title="Moths" class="mw-redirect">moths</a> but may also include tree bugs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stink_bug" title="Stink bug" class="mw-redirect">stink bugs</a>, beetles, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee" title="Bee">bees</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ants</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly" title="Fly">flies</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly" title="Dragonfly">dragonflies</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper" title="Grasshopper">grasshoppers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket" title="Cricket">crickets</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a> and on some occasions, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail" title="Snail">snails</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Fruit feeding is seen mostly during migration and overwintering, especially when overwintering in more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical" title="Tropical" class="mw-redirect">tropical</a> regions where fruit is more abundant or if the insect populations are low. This large and varying diet can be attributed to a more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_feeder" title="Opportunistic feeder" class="mw-redirect">opportunistic</a> feeding strategy, allowing the Blue-headed Vireo to be plastic in its ability to adapt to resource availability.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
When arriving to the breeding ground in mid-April, male Vireos will hold large, individual territories that can range from 1.5-6.6 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare" title="Hectare">hectares</a>. Females will choose a male to mate with depending on the male’s ability to defend and control a large territory. While defending their territory from other males, the male Vireos will sing a primary song to attract females.<sup id="cite_ref-James2_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James2-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Undecided females can usually be seen flying along the edges of competing male territories; usually this will force the two males into direct conflict for the right to copulate with the female.<sup id="cite_ref-Morton_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Morton-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-James2_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James2-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
Once a female has approached a suitable mate, the male will perform a series of mating rituals. Typically, these rituals involve the male building a courtship nest for the female. The courtship nest is not a full nest but is most likely an attempt by the male to display his ability to gather resources.<sup id="cite_ref-Morton_10-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Morton-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-James2_12-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James2-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Once the pair is established, the courtship nest is abandoned. Mating does not occur for approximately 2 weeks after pair has been established. During this time, the male and the female will cooperatively build a breeding nest which is typically formed between forking mid level branches of evergreen and deciduous trees and are composed of twigs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foliage" title="Foliage" class="mw-redirect">foliage</a>. Breeding nests are not reused in following breeding seasons.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
In one breeding season, a female will lay 3-5 eggs at a rate of 1 egg/day. Eggs are creamy white with brown or black spots and are 17-23.1 millimetres x 13.3-15.8 millimetres (0.055-0.075 in x 0.04-0.05 in). Eggs are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubated</a> for approximately 14 days after being laid. Once hatched, infants are highly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" title="Altricial">altricial</a>, often having little to no downy feathers. Infants open their eyes during day 5 or 6 and will begin to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> after 14 days for a total chick-rearing period of 28 days. Once the young are able to leave the nest, the parents will split the juveniles and separate. Juveniles are usually dependant on the parent to provide food for approximately 1 month after leaving the nest. If the nest is destroyed or a mating pair produces a failed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooding" title="Brooding" class="mw-redirect">brood</a>, an attempt to re-nest may occur but this ultimately depends on when the brood fails. If the brood fails early on in the season, there is a higher chance that the pair will re-nest, if later, the pair will often separate and not attempt a second brood.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Blue-headed Vireo’s have an atypical breeding strategy when compared to other closely related species. Blue-headed Vireo males will assist their mates with daytime incubation of eggs, nest construction, and feeding of the chicks (Morton et al. 1998). Also, unlike most bird species, female Blue-headed Vireos do not attempt any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-pair_copulations" title="Extra-pair copulations" class="mw-redirect">extra-pair copulations</a> with other males. Likewise, males make no attempt to guard females from other males, making Blue-headed Vireos both socially and genetically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a> birds.<sup id="cite_ref-Morton_10-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Morton-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
The increase in male Blue-headed Vireo parental care is thought to be attributed to the levels of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin" title="Prolactin">prolactin</a> found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma" title="Blood plasma">plasma</a> of these birds during the mating season. Testosterone, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid_hormone" title="Steroid hormone">steroid hormone</a> that is secreted by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testes" title="Testes" class="mw-redirect">testes</a>, has been found to increase aggressive behaviour in male birds during the breeding season<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> and that these males display less parental care if their testosterone levels are maintained.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Conversely, prolactin is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_hormone" title="Peptide hormone">peptide hormone</a> that is regulated by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus" title="Hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a> that has been found at higher levels in birds that do the majority of incubation.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> It was found that in the early breeding season, male Blue-headed Vireos have a low testosterone level and will maintain this low level at all stages of the season.<sup id="cite_ref-Vanroo_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Vanroo-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> This low level does not affect the Vireo’s ability to compete with other males for territory however, as a high testosterone level has been found to not be necessary for territory establishment.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> Prolactin levels of the males were found to be high very early on in the breeding season and are maintained for the duration of the season. This high level of prolactin along with a low testosterone level, explains why male Blue-headed Vireos are so involved in the construction of the nest, daytime incubation, and feeding of the nestlings.<sup id="cite_ref-Morton_10-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Morton-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Vanroo_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Vanroo-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
Blue-headed Vireos have a low nesting success rate, with about 10-30 percent of hatchlings surviving.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Common predators of the Blue-headed Vireo eggs and chicks include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_jay" title="Blue jay" class="mw-redirect">Blue jays</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crows" title="Crows" class="mw-redirect">Crows</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrels" title="Squirrels" class="mw-redirect">Squirrels</a>.
Often, when a nest is attacked by a blue-jay, the male and female will execute coordinated attacks on the approaching predator. This usually involves one partner swooping towards the blue-jay while calling the mate who will then execute a second attack.<sup id="cite_ref-Morton_10-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Morton-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Blue-headed Vireos have also been known to nest close to nesting raptorial birds that do not prey on them. It is thought that they use the raptors as protection from squirrels that are, in turn, hunted by the these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">bird of prey</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The largest contributor to the low nesting success rate of the Blue-headed Vireo is most likely the parasitic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-headed_Cowbird" title="Brown-headed Cowbird">Brown-headed Cowbird</a> (<i>Molothrus ater</i>). These birds will often lay their large eggs overtop the existing brood, causing the parents to feed the cowbird which will ultimately starve the infant Vireos.<sup id="cite_ref-James_3-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
