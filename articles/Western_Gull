The <b>Western Gull</b> (<i>Larus occidentalis</i>) is a large white-headed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gull</a> that lives on the western coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. It was previously considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific" title="Conspecific" class="mw-redirect">conspecific</a>, the same species, with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-footed_Gull" title="Yellow-footed Gull">Yellow-footed Gull</a> (<i>Larus livens</i>) of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_California" title="Gulf of California">Gulf of California</a>.

Despite being a well-known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> species on the West Coast of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">US</a>, it is of some slight <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology" title="Conservation biology">conservation</a> concern given its restricted range (for a gull).
The Western Gull is a large gull that can measure 55 to 68 cm (22 to 27 in) in total length, spans 130 to 144 cm (51 to 57 in) across the wings and weighs 800 to 1,400 g (1.8 to 3.1 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-Olsen_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Olsen-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Harrison_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrison-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The average mass among a survey of 48 gulls of the species was 1,011&nbsp;g (2.23&nbsp;lb).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 38 to 44.8 cm (15 to 17.6 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 4.7 to 6.2 cm (1.9 to 2.4 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 5.8 to 7.5 cm (2.3 to 3.0 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Olsen_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Olsen-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The Western Gull has a white head and body, and gray wings. It has a yellow bill with a red subterminal spot (this is the small spot near the end of the bill that chicks peck in order to stimulate feeding). It closely resembles the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaty-backed_Gull" title="Slaty-backed Gull">Slaty-backed Gull</a> (<i>Larus schistisagus</i>). In the north of its range it forms a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_zone" title="Hybrid zone">hybrid zone</a> with its close relative the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucous-winged_Gull" title="Glaucous-winged Gull">Glaucous-winged Gull</a> (<i>Larus glaucescens</i>). Western gulls take approximately four years to reach their full <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-audubon_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-audubon-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> their layer of feathers and the patterns and colors on the feathers. The Western Gull typically lives about 15 years, but can live to at least 25 years.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from July 2010">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The largest Western gull colony is on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Islands" title="Farallon Islands">Farallon Islands</a>, located about 26&nbsp;mi (40&nbsp;km) west of San Francisco, California.<sup id="cite_ref-ref1_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ref1-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Western Gull is rarely encountered inland or away from the ocean<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> and is almost an exclusively <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">marine</a> gull. It nests on offshore islands and rocks along the coast, and on islands inside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuaries</a>, and a colony also exists on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatraz_Island" title="Alcatraz Island">Alcatraz Island</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay" title="San Francisco Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>. In the colonies, long term pairs aggressively defend territories whose borders may shift slightly from year to year, but are maintained for the life of the male.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from July 2010">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
Western Gulls feed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic" title="Pelagic" class="mw-redirect">pelagic</a> environments, areas in the ocean not near the shore, and in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertidal" title="Intertidal" class="mw-redirect">intertidal</a> environments, areas exposed to the air at low tide and underwater at high tide. At sea they take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a><sup id="cite_ref-ref1_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ref1-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill" title="Krill">krill</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid" title="Squid">squid</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish" title="Jellyfish">jellyfish</a>. They cannot dive, and feed exclusively on the surface. On land they feed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_seal" title="True seal" class="mw-redirect">seal</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lion" title="Sea lion">sea lion</a> carcasses, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockle_(bivalve)" title="Cockle (bivalve)">cockles</a>, starfish, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpet" title="Limpet">limpets</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail" title="Snail">snails</a> in the intertidal zone. They also feed on human food refuse, in human-altered habitats, including waste <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill" title="Landfill">landfills</a>, and taking food from people at marinas and beaches. At times some Western Gulls can be predatory, preying on the young of other birds and even adults of some species. One Western Gull at Oakland's Lake Merrit was known for killing and eating pigeons (Rock Doves) on a daily basis. Western Gulls also will snatch a fish from a cormorant's or pelican's mouth before it is swallowed.
A nest of vegetation is constructed inside the territory, and three eggs are laid. These eggs are incubated for a month. The chicks, once hatched, remain inside the territory until they have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledged</a>. Chicks straying into the territory of another gull are liable to be killed by that territory's pair. Chick mortality is high, with on average one chick surviving to fledging. On occasion, abandoned chicks will be adopted by other gulls.
In Washington state, the Western Gull <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybridizes</a> frequently with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucous-winged_Gull" title="Glaucous-winged Gull">Glaucous-winged Gull</a>, and may closely resemble a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thayer%27s_Gull" title="Thayer's Gull">Thayer's Gull</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The hybrids have a flatter and larger head and a thicker bill with a pronounced angle on the lower part of the bill, which distinguishes it from the smaller Thayer's Gull.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Western Gull is currently not considered threatened. However, they have, for a gull, a restricted range. Numbers were greatly reduced in the 19th century by the taking of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> eggs for the growing city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Western Gull colonies also suffered from disturbance where they were turned into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse" title="Lighthouse">lighthouse</a> stations, or, in the case of Alcatraz, a prison.
Western Gulls are very aggressive when defending their territories and consequently were persecuted by some as a menace. The automating of the lighthouses, and the closing of Alcatraz Prison, allowed the species to reclaim parts of its range. They are currently vulnerable to climatic events like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o" title="El Niño" class="mw-redirect">El Niño</a> events and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_spill" title="Oil spill">oil spills</a>.
