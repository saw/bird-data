The <b>Great Cormorant</b> (<i>Phalacrocorax carbo</i>), known as the <b>Great Black Cormorant</b> across the Northern Hemisphere, the <b>Black Cormorant</b> in Australia, the <b>Large Cormorant</b> in India and the <b>Black Shag</b> further south in New Zealand, is a widespread member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormorant" title="Cormorant">cormorant</a> family of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabirds</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It breeds in much of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World" title="Old World">Old World</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>.
The Great Cormorant is a large black bird, but there is a wide variation in size in the species wide range. Weight is reported from 1.5&nbsp;kg (3.3&nbsp;lbs)<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> to 5.3&nbsp;kg (11.7&nbsp;lbs),<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> with a typical range from 2.6 to 3.7&nbsp;kg (5.7–8.2&nbsp;lbs).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Length can vary from 70 to 102&nbsp;cm (28–40&nbsp;in) and wingspan from 121 to 160&nbsp;cm (48–63&nbsp;in).<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> It has a longish tail and yellow throat-patch. Adults have white thigh patches in the breeding season. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> waters it can be distinguished from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Shag" title="Common Shag" class="mw-redirect">Common Shag</a> by its larger size, heavier build, thicker bill, lack of a crest and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">plumage</a> without any green tinge. In eastern North America, it is similarly larger and bulkier than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-crested_Cormorant" title="Double-crested Cormorant">Double-crested Cormorant</a>, and the latter species has more yellow on the throat and bill. Great Cormorants are mostly silent, but they make various guttural noises at their breeding colonies.
A very rare variation of the Great Cormorant is caused by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism" title="Albinism">albinism</a>. The <i>Phalacrocorax carbo</i> albino suffers from loss of eyesight and/or hearing, thus it rarely manages to survive in the wild.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from June 2011">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
This is a very common and widespread <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> species. It feeds on the sea, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuaries</a>, and on freshwater lakes and rivers.

In addition to the Australasian and African forms, <i>Phalacrocorax carbo novaehollandiae</i> and <i>P. carbo lucidus</i> mentioned above, other geographically distinct subspecies are recognised, including <i>P. c. sinensis</i> (western Europe to east <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>), <i>P. c. maroccanus</i> (north-western Africa), and <i>P. c. hannedae</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>).

The Great Cormorant breeds mainly on coasts, nesting on cliffs or in trees (which are eventually killed by the droppings), but also increasingly inland. 3–4 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> are laid in a nest of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed" title="Seaweed">seaweed</a> or twigs.
The Great Cormorant can dive to considerable depths, but often feeds in shallow water. It frequently brings prey to the surface. A wide variety of fish are taken: cormorants are often noticed eating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eel" title="Eel">eels</a>, but this may reflect the considerable time taken to subdue an eel and position it for swallowing, rather than any dominance of eels in the diet. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> waters, dive times of 20–30 seconds are common, with a recovery time on the surface around a third of the dive time.
Many fishermen see in the Great Cormorant a competitor for fish. Because of this it was nearly hunted to extinction in the past. Thanks to conservation efforts its numbers increased. At the moment there are about 1.2 million birds in Europe (based on winter counts. Late summer counts would show higher numbers).<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Increasing populations have once again brought the cormorant into conflict with fisheries.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> For example, in Britain, where inland breeding was once uncommon, there are now increasing numbers of birds breeding inland, and many inland fish farms and fisheries now claim to be suffering high losses due to these birds. In the UK each year some licences are issued to shoot specified numbers of cormorants in order to help reduce predation, it is however still illegal to kill a bird without such a licence.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormorant_fishing" title="Cormorant fishing">Cormorant fishing</a> is practiced in China, Japan, and elsewhere around the globe. In it, fishermen tie a line around the throats of cormorants, tight enough to prevent swallowing, and deploy them from small boats. The cormorants catch fish without being able to fully swallow them, and the fishermen are able to retrieve the fish simply by forcing open the cormorants' mouths, apparently engaging the regurgitation reflex.
In Norway cormorant is a traditional game bird. Each year ca. 10,000 cormorants are shot to be eaten.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> In North Norway, cormorants are traditionally seen as semi-sacred.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from June 2009">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> It is regarded as good luck to have cormorants gather near your village or settlement. An old legend states that people who die far out at sea, their bodies never recovered, spend eternity on the island Utrøst – which can only occasionally be found by mortals. The inhabitants of Utrøst can only visit their homes in the shape of cormorants.<br style="clear: both;" />
