This large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingfisher" title="Kingfisher">kingfisher</a> breeds by streams. The unlined nest is in a horizontal tunnel made in a river bank, and up to 1.6 m long and 10&nbsp;cm wide. The female lays three, sometimes four, white eggs.
The Amazon Kingfisher resembles the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Kingfisher" title="Green Kingfisher">Green Kingfisher</a> which shares its range, but it is much larger than its relative, and three to four times as heavy. It is 29â€“30&nbsp;cm long and weighs 110g. It has the typical kingfisher shape, with a short tail and long bill. It is oily green above, with a shaggy crest and a white collar around the neck. It lacks the white markings on the wings shown by Green Kingfisher.
Males have white underparts apart from a broad chestnut breast band and some green streaks on the flanks. Females have white underparts with green patches on the side of the chest and green flank streaks. Young birds resemble the adult female, but have white spots on the wings. There are no recognised subspecies of Amazon Kingfisher.
