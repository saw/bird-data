The Reed Bunting is a medium sized bird, 13.5-15.5&nbsp;cm long, with a small but sturdy seed-eater's bill. The male has a black head and throat, white neck collar and underparts, and a heavily streaked brown back. The female is much duller, with a streaked brown head, and is more streaked below.
Its natural food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds. The nest is in a bush or reed tussock. 4-7 eggs are laid, which show the hair-like markings characteristic of those of buntings.
