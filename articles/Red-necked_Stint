<i>Erolia ruficollis</i>
The <b>Red-necked Stint</b> (<i>Calidris ruficollis</i>) is a small migratory <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">wader</a>.
These birds are among the smallest of waders, very similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Stint" title="Little Stint">Little Stint</a>, <i>Calidris minuta</i>, with which they were once considered conspecific. The Red-necked Stint's small size, fine dark bill, dark legs and quicker movements distinguish this species from all waders except the other dark-legged stints. It measures 13–17 cm (5.1–6.7 in) in length, 28–37 cm (11–15 in) in wingspan and 21–51 g (0.74–1.8 oz) in body mass.<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It can be distinguished from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sandpiper" title="Western Sandpiper">Western Sandpiper</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipalmated_Sandpiper" title="Semipalmated Sandpiper">Semipalmated Sandpiper</a> in all plumages by its combination of a fine bill tip, unwebbed toes, and longer primary projection.
The breeding adult has an unstreaked orange breast, bordered with dark markings below, and a white V on its back. In winter plumage identification is difficult, although it is shorter legged and longer winged than the Little Stint. Juveniles have more contrasting mantle plumage and weaker white lines down the back than their relative. The call is a hoarse "stit".
Red-necked Stints are strongly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, breeding along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littoral" title="Littoral" class="mw-redirect">littoral</a> of eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and spending the non-breedng season in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_Asia" title="South East Asia" class="mw-redirect">South East Asia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia" title="Australasia">Australasia</a> as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. They are rare vagrants to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. They are often seen in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> and occasionally elsewhere in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a>.
Red-necked Stints are highly gregarious, and will form flocks with other small <i>Calidris</i> waders, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp-tailed_Sandpiper" title="Sharp-tailed Sandpiper">Sharp-tailed Sandpipers</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curlew_Sandpiper" title="Curlew Sandpiper">Curlew Sandpipers</a> in their non-breeding areas. See it here with Curlew Sandpiper.
Their breeding habitat is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a>. They nest on the ground and breed from spring to summer.
They forage in wet grassland and soft mud, mainly picking up food by sight. In their non-breeding habitat they feed on intertidal mudflats and along the muddy margins of freshwater lakes. They mainly eat insects and other small invertebrates.
