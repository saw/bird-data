<i>Centurus carolinus</i><br />
<i>Picus carolinus</i> <small>Linnaeus, 1758</small>
The <b>Red-bellied Woodpecker</b> (<i>Melanerpes carolinus</i>) is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picidae" title="Picidae" class="mw-redirect">Picidae</a> family. It breeds in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States" title="Northeastern United States">northeastern United States</a>, ranging as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> and as far west as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>. Its common name is somewhat misleading, as the most prominent red part of its plumage is on the head; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-headed_Woodpecker" title="Red-headed Woodpecker">Red-headed Woodpecker</a> however is another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> that is a rather close relative but looks quite different.
It was first described in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaeus" title="Linnaeus" class="mw-redirect">Linnaeus</a>' <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae" title="Systema Naturae">Systema Naturae</a></i>, as <i>Picus carolinus</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_locality_(biology)" title="Type locality (biology)" class="mw-redirect">type locality</a> is given simply as "<i>America septentrionalis</i>" (North America).

Adults are mainly light gray on the face and underparts; they have black and white barred patterns on their back, wings and tail. Adult males have a red headside going from the bill to the nape; females have a red patch on the nape and another above the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a>. The reddish tinge on the belly that gives the bird its name is difficult to see in field identification. They are 9 to 10.5&nbsp;inches long, and have a wingspan of 15 to 18&nbsp;inches.
Red-bellied woodpeckers are noisy birds, and have many varied <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_song" title="Bird song" class="mw-redirect">calls</a>. Calls have been described as sounding like <i>churr-churr-churr</i> or <i>thrraa-thrraa-thrraa</i> with an alternating <i>br-r-r-r-t</i> sound. Males tend to call and drum more frequently than females, but both sexes call. Often, these woodpeckers "drum" to attract mates. They tap on aluminum roofs, metal guttering, hollow trees and even transformer boxes, in urban environments, to communicate with potential partners. Babies have a high-pitched begging call of "pree-pree-pree" They will continue to give a begging call whenever they see their parents for a while after fledging.
These birds mainly search out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a> on tree trunks. They may also catch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> in flight. They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore" title="Omnivore">omnivores</a>, eating insects, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a>, nuts and seeds. Their breeding habitat is usually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> forests. They nest in the decayed cavities of dead trees, old stumps, or in live trees that have softer wood such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elms" title="Elms" class="mw-redirect">elms</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple" title="Maple">maples</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willows" title="Willows" class="mw-redirect">willows</a>; both sexes assist in digging nesting cavities. Areas around nest sites are marked with drilling holes to warn others away.
Though the species is not globally threatened, it depends on large trees for nesting. In areas that are extensively <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforested</a>, the birds will sometimes utilize <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden" title="Garden">gardens</a>, but for the most part simply will not be present in any numbers.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Red-bellied Woodpecker has extended its breeding range north over the last 100 years. Populations are increasing throughout most of the range. Red List Category &amp; Criteria: Least Concern ver 3.1 Year Published: 2012 Assessor/s: BirdLife International Reviewer/s: Butchart, S. &amp; Symes, A. Contributor/s: Justification: This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km2 combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The population trend appears to be increasing, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.

Predators of adult red-bellied woodpeckers include birds of prey such as sharp-shinned hawks and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper%27s_hawk" title="Cooper's hawk" class="mw-redirect">Cooper's hawks</a>, black rat snakes and house <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" title="Cat">cats</a>. Known predators of nestlings and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a> include red-headed woodpeckers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owls</a>, pileated woodpeckers, gray rat snakes and black rat snakes. When approached by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator" class="mw-redirect">predator</a>, red-bellied woodpeckers either hide from the predator, or harass it with alarm calls. They defend their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nests</a> and young aggressively, and may directly attack predators that come near the nest.
