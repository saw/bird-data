<i>Vultur papa</i> L.
The <b>King Vulture</b> (<i>Sarcoramphus papa</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>. It is a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_vulture" title="New World vulture">New World vulture</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathartidae" title="Cathartidae" class="mw-redirect">Cathartidae</a>. This vulture lives predominantly in tropical lowland forests stretching from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>. It is the only surviving member of the genus <i><b>Sarcoramphus</b></i>, although fossil members are known.
Large and predominantly white, the King Vulture has gray to black ruff, flight, and tail <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">feathers</a>. The head and neck are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The King Vulture has a very noticeable yellow fleshy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattle_(anatomy)" title="Wattle (anatomy)">caruncle</a> on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass. King Vultures have been known to live for up to 30 years in captivity.
King Vultures were popular figures in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayan_codices" title="Mayan codices" class="mw-redirect">Mayan codices</a> as well as in local folklore and medicine. Although currently listed as Least Concern by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>, they are decreasing in number, due primarily to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_loss" title="Habitat loss" class="mw-redirect">habitat loss</a>.
The King Vulture was originally described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus" title="Carl Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1758 in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae" title="10th edition of Systema Naturae">tenth edition</a> of his <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae" title="Systema Naturae">Systema Naturae</a></i> as <i>Vultur papa</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> the type specimen originally collected in Surinam.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> It was reassigned to the genus <i>Sarcoramphus</i> in 1805 by French zoologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Marie_Constant_Dum%C3%A9ril" title="André Marie Constant Duméril">André Marie Constant Duméril</a>. The generic name is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Latin" title="New Latin">New Latin</a> compound formed from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Greek</a> words σάρξ (<i>sarx</i>, "flesh", the combining form of which is σαρκο-) and ῥάμφος (<i>rhamphos</i>, "crooked beak of bird of prey").<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The genus name is often misspelled as <i>Sarcor<b>h</b>amphus</i>, improperly retaining the Greek <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_breathing" title="Rough breathing">rough breathing</a> despite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutination" title="Agglutination">agglutination</a> with the previous word-element.

There are two theories on how the King Vulture earned the "King" part of its common name.

The genus <i>Sarcoramphus</i>, which today contains only the King Vulture, had a wider distribution in the past.

Little can be said of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolutionary</a> history of the genus, mainly because remains of other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neogene" title="Neogene">Neogene</a> New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary.

A "<b>Painted Vulture</b>" ("<i><b>Sarcoramphus sacra</b></i>" or "<i><b>S. papa sacra</b></i>") is described in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bartram" title="William Bartram">William Bartram</a>'s notes of his travels in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> during the 1770s.

While most early ornithologists defended Bartram's honesty, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Asaph_Allen" title="Joel Asaph Allen">Joel Asaph Allen</a> argued that the Painted Vulture was mythical and that Bartram mixed elements of different species to create this bird.<sup id="cite_ref-Harper_22-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harper-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Allen pointed out that the birds' behavior, as recorded by Bartram, is in complete agreement with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracara" title="Caracara">caracara</a>'s.<sup id="cite_ref-Harper_22-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harper-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> For example, Bartram observed the birds following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire" title="Wildfire">wildfires</a> to scavenge for burned insects and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_turtle" title="Box turtle">box turtles</a>.

Although it locates food by vision, the role smell has in how it specifically finds carrion has been debated.
