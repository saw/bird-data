<i>Parus sclateri</i>
The <b>Mexican Chickadee</b> (<i>Poecile sclateri</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbird</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_(bird)" title="Tit (bird)">tit</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> Paridae. It is still often placed in the genus <i>Parus</i> with most other tits, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MtDNA" title="MtDNA" class="mw-redirect">mtDNA</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_b" title="Cytochrome b">cytochrome <i>b</i></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequence" title="DNA sequence" class="mw-redirect">sequence</a> data and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphology</a> suggest that separating <i>Poecile</i> more adequately expresses these birds' relationships (Gill <i>et al.</i>, 2005). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> had been treating <i>Poecile</i> as distinct genus for some time already.
Adults are 12.5–13.5&nbsp;cm long with a wingspan of 18–21&nbsp;cm and a weight of 7.5–11 g. Both sexes have a black cap, white cheeks, and a short black bill. Their backs and flanks are gray and they have paler grayish underparts. Similar in appearance to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-capped_Chickadee" title="Black-capped Chickadee">Black-capped Chickadee</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Chickadee" title="Mountain Chickadee">Mountain Chickadee</a>, the Mexican Chickadee can be distinguished by its longer black bib, which extends from its chin down onto its upper breast. A whitish band below the bib extends down the center of the belly.
It is a permanent resident of wooded highlands in western, central and northeastern Mexico, the range extends north into extreme southeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> and southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>. Although primarily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">nonmigratory</a>, Mexican Chickadees sometimes fly to lower elevations during the cold of winter.
The Mexican Chickadee's song is distinct from other chickadees; it is a complex burry trilled whistle of <i>chischu-wur</i> and a rich <i>cheelee</i>. They travel in pairs or small groups, and may join multi-species feeding flocks.
The nest is constructed by the female in a snag or tree cavity up to 18 m above the ground, and consists of grasses, moss, strips of bark, and is lined with animal fur. She lays between five and eight ovate white eggs, marked with fine reddish brown spots. Their breeding biology is not well known, but it is estimated that eggs are incubated for 11–14 days by the female, and the altricial young fledge in 18–21 days.
