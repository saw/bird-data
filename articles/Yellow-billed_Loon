The <b>Yellow-billed Loon</b> (<i>Gavia adamsii</i>), also known as the <b>White-billed Diver</b>, is the largest member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loon" title="Loon">loon</a> or diver family. Breeding adults have a black head, white underparts and chequered black-and-white mantle. Non-breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">plumage</a> is drabber with the chin and foreneck white. The main distinguishing feature from Great Northern Loon is the longer straw-yellow bill which, because the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmen_(bird)" title="Culmen (bird)" class="mw-redirect">culmen</a> is straight, appears slightly uptilted.
It breeds in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> and winters mainly at sea along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast" title="Coast">coasts</a> of the northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and northwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a>; it also sometimes overwinters on large inland lakes. It occasionally strays well south of its normal wintering range, and has been recorded as a vagrant in more than 22 countries. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a>, like all divers, is a specialist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>-eater, catching its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey" title="Prey" class="mw-redirect">prey</a> underwater. Its call is an eerie wailing, lower pitched than Great Northern Diver.
First described by English zoologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Robert_Gray" title="George Robert Gray">George Robert Gray</a> in 1859 based on a specimen collected in Alaska, the Yellow-billed Loon is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotype_(biology)" title="Monotype (biology)" class="mw-redirect">monotypic</a> species, with no subspecies despite its large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holarctic" title="Holarctic">Holarctic</a> range.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW172_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW172-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It is closely related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_Loon" title="Great Northern Loon">Great Northern Loon</a>, which it strongly resembles in plumage and behaviour; some taxonomists consider the two species to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric" title="Allopatric" class="mw-redirect">allopatric</a> forms of the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superspecies" title="Superspecies">superspecies</a>.

Though it prefers freshwater pools or lakes in the tundra, the Yellow-billed Loon will also breed along rivers, estuaries or the coast in low-lying areas of the Arctic; in general, it avoids forested areas. Breeding typically starts in early June, though it is dependent on the timing of the spring thaw. Like all members of its family, the Yellow-billed Loon builds a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> of plant material very close to the edge of the water. The female lays two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW172_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW172-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
