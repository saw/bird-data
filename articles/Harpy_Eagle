The <b>Harpy Eagle</b> (<i>Harpia harpyja</i>), is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neotropic_ecozone" title="Neotropic ecozone">Neotropical</a> species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle" title="Eagle">eagle</a>. It is sometimes known as the <b>American Harpy Eagle</b> to distinguish it from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papuan_Eagle" title="Papuan Eagle">Papuan Eagle</a> which is sometimes known as the New Guinea Harpy Eagle or Papuan Harpy Eagle. It is the largest and most powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">raptor</a> found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a>, and among the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extant_taxon" title="Extant taxon">extant</a> species of eagles in the world.

Destruction of its natural habitat has seen it vanish from many parts of its former range, and it is nearly extirpated in Central America.

These were wind spirits that took the dead to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades" title="Hades">Hades</a>, and were said to have a body like an eagle and the face of a human.
The upper side of the Harpy Eagle is covered with slate black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">feathers</a>, and the underside is mostly white, except for the feathered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsometatarsus" title="Tarsometatarsus">tarsi</a>, which are striped black. There is a broad black band across the upper breast, separating the gray head from the white belly. The head is pale grey, and is crowned with a double crest. The upperside of the tail is black with three gray bands, while the underside of it is black with three white bands. The iris is gray or brown, the cere and bill are black or blackish and the tarsi and toes are yellow.

This species is largely silent away from the nest. There, the adults give a penetrating, weak, melancholy scream, with the incubating male's call described as <i>Wheeeeeeeeee-wheeeeeee-wheeeeeeeee</i>. The females calls while incubating are similar but are lower pitched. While approaching the nest with food, the male calls out "rapid chirps, goose-like calls, and occasional sharp screams". Vocalization in both parents decreases as the nestlings age, while the nestlings become more vocal. The nestlings call <i>Chi-chi-chi...chi-chi-chi-chi</i>, seemingly in alarm in respond to rain or direct sunlight. When humans approach the nest, the nestling have been described as uttering croaks, quacks and whistles.<sup id="cite_ref-Rettig1978_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rettig1978-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>

Sometimes, Harpy Eagles will still-hunt, a common hunting strategy in other forest-dwelling raptors.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> In Harpys, this consists of looking and listening for long periods of time from a high perch near an opening, a river or salt-lick (where many mammals go to feed for nutrients).<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The more common hunting technique of the species is perch-hunting, which consists of scanning around for prey activity while briefly perched between short flights from tree to tree.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> When prey is spotted, a fast swoop or snatch occurs, after which the talons often kill the prey in seconds.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> On occasion, Harpy Eagles may also hunt by flying adjacent to or right over the canopy.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> They have also been observed tail-chasing, a predation style common to the bird-hunting <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter" title="Accipiter">Accipiter</a></i> hawks.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> While tail-chasing, they pursue a bird closely in flight while twisting between trees, vines and branches, a skill that requires both considerable speed and great agility.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
In ideal habitats, nests can be found fairly close to one another. In some parts of Panama and Guyana, active nests were located 3&nbsp;km (1.9&nbsp;mi) away from one another, while were within 5&nbsp;km (3.1&nbsp;mi) of each other in Venezuela. In Peru, the average distance between nests was 7.4&nbsp;km (4.6&nbsp;mi) and the average area occupied by each breeding pairs was estimated at 4,300&nbsp;ha (11,000 acres). In less ideal areas, with fragemented forest, breeding territories were estimated at 25&nbsp;km (16&nbsp;mi).<sup id="cite_ref-Bierregaard_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bierregaard-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> The female Harpy Eagle lays two white eggs in a large stick nest, which commonly measures 1.2&nbsp;m (3.9&nbsp;ft) deep and 1.5&nbsp;m (4.9&nbsp;ft) across and may be used over several years. Nests are located high up in a tree, usually in the main fork, at 16 to 43 m (52 to 141 ft), depending on the stature of the local trees. The harpy often builds its nest in the crown of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapok" title="Kapok" class="mw-redirect">kapok</a> tree, one of the tallest trees in South America. In many South American cultures it is considered bad luck to cut down the kapok tree, which may help safeguard the habitat of this stately eagle.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> The bird also uses other huge trees to build its nest on, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_nut" title="Brazil nut">Brazil nut</a> tree.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> A nesting site found in the Brazilian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantanal" title="Pantanal">Pantanal</a> was built on a <i>Cambará</i> tree (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vochysia" title="Vochysia">Vochysia divergens</a></i>).<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup>
There is no known display between pairs of eagles and they are believed to mate for life. A pair of Harpy Eagles usually only raise one chick every 2–3 years. After the first chick hatches, the second egg is ignored and normally fails to hatch unless the first egg perishes. The egg is incubated for around 56 days. When the chick is 36 days old, it can stand and walk awkwardly. The chick fledges at the age of 6 months, but the parents continue to feed it for another 6 to 10 months. The male captures much of the food for the incubating female and later the eaglet, but will also take an incubating shift while the female forages and also brings prey back to the nest. Breeding maturity is not reached until birds are 4 to 6 years of age.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Rettig1978_13-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rettig1978-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Remote_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Remote-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> Adults can be aggressive toward humans who disturb the nesting site or appear to be a threat to its young.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup>
Although the Harpy Eagle still occurs over a considerable range, its distribution and populations have dwindled considerably. It is threatened primarily by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_loss" title="Habitat loss" class="mw-redirect">habitat loss</a> provoked by the expansion of logging, cattle ranching, agriculture and prospecting.
