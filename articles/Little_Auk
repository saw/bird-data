This is the only Atlantic auk of its size, half the size of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Puffin" title="Atlantic Puffin">Atlantic Puffin</a> at 19–21&nbsp;cm in length, with a 34–38&nbsp;cm wingspan. Adult birds are black on the head, neck, back and wings, with white underparts. The bill is very short and stubby. They have a small rounded black tail. The lower face and fore neck become white in winter.
The flight is direct, with fast whirring wing beats due to the short wings. These birds forage for food like other auks by swimming underwater. They mainly eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copepod" title="Copepod">copepods</a>, but also other small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> along with small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>. They collect in large swarms before leaving their breeding rocks to head out to sea for food as well as when they return.
Little Auks produce a variety of twitters and cackling calls at the breeding colonies, but are silent at sea.
Their breeding habitat is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast" title="Coast">coastal</a> mountainsides, where they have large colonies. They nest in crevices or beneath large rocks, usually laying just one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">egg</a>.

In the book, <i>The Long Winter</i>, Laura Ingalls Wilder writes of her father finding a small bird that looked just like a Great Auk hidden in a haystack after an early October blizzard when the family lived near De Smet, South Dakota around 1880. The family never did find out what it was, but it appears to have been a Little Auk, blown south by the autumn blizzard.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiviaq_(food)" title="Kiviaq (food)" class="mw-redirect">Kiviaq</a> is an Inuit dish from Greenland. It is made by stuffing a seal skin with 300 to 500 dovekies. Once full and airtight, the skin is sealed with seal fat and the dovekies are left to ferment for 3 to 18 months under a pile of rocks. Caught in spring, the dovekies serve as a food resource in winter.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knud_Rasmussen" title="Knud Rasmussen">Knud Rasmussen</a>'s death is attributed to food poisoning by kiviaq.
