<i>Ardea pinnata</i> <small>Wagler, 1829</small>
The <b>Pinnated Bittern</b> (<i>Botaurus pinnatus</i>), also known as the <b>South American Bittern</b>, is a large member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron" title="Heron">heron</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> (Ardeidae) found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics" title="Tropics">tropics</a>. Like the other <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botaurus" title="Botaurus">Botaurus</a></i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittern" title="Bittern">bitterns</a>, its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> is mostly buffy-brown and cryptically patterned. Though it is a widespread species, it is rarely seen – presumably due to its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skulking" title="Skulking" class="mw-redirect">skulking</a> habits – and much about its life history remains little known.
The Pinnated Bittern is a large heron, measuring between 25–30 in (63.5–76&nbsp;cm) with a weight of roughly 1.8&nbsp;lb (800 g)<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from November 2008">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>. Sexes are similarly plumaged, but females tend to be smaller than males and have brown instead of black on the tail.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
Both adults and immatures are generally buffy, though heavily marked with cryptic patterning. Juveniles tend to have a somewhat more reddish ground color. The throat is unmarked white, the foreneck is white broadly streaked with pale brown, and the rest of the neck is buff with thin black barring. The breast and belly are white with broad pale brown streaks, while the back is buff, heavily streaked and barred with black. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feathers" title="Flight feathers" class="mw-redirect">Rectrices</a> are black in males and brown in females; the slate-grey <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">remiges</a> create a conspicuous two-toned effect in flight.
The bill is stout and strong, yellowish overall with a dusky upper mandible. The bare facial skin is bright yellow, with a brown line running across the lores. The legs are greenish-yellow, and the iris is yellow.
If flushed, the Pinnated Bittern gives a rough <i>rawk-rawk-rawk</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_song" title="Bird song" class="mw-redirect">call</a>. During the breeding season, the male booms at dusk and into the night; his call is a deep <i>poonk</i> or <i>poonkoo</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-ss1989_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ss1989-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
German <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history" title="Natural history">naturalist</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Wagler" title="Johann Georg Wagler">Johann Georg Wagler</a>, who first described the Pinnated Bittern in 1829, placed it in the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardea_(genus)" title="Ardea (genus)">Ardea</a></i> at that time. It is sometimes included in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superspecies" title="Superspecies">superspecies</a> with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bittern" title="American Bittern">American Bittern</a> (<i>B. lentiginosus</i>), while other authors consider the entire genus <i>Botaurus</i> to consist of a single superspecies.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>

The alternate name "South American Bittern" is a bit misleading, as the species is found as far north as southern Mexico. Its range stretches from the Atlantic slope of southeastern Mexico to northern Argentina, though there are few records for Guatemala and for Honduras. The species occurs mainly in low-lying regions, but has been recorded in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordillera_Oriental_(Colombia)" title="Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)">Cordillera Oriental</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> as much as 8,500&nbsp;ft (2,600 m) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level" title="Above mean sea level">ASL</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
It can be found in a variety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater" title="Freshwater" class="mw-redirect">freshwater</a> habitats, including dense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reedbeds" title="Reedbeds" class="mw-redirect">reedbeds</a> and lake borders, flooded tall-grass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasture" title="Pasture">pastures</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a> and overgrown ditches. Typically, the vegetation in its habitat is dominated by tall <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyperaceae" title="Cyperaceae">sedges</a> (Cyperaceae), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_hyacinth" title="Water hyacinth">water hyacinth</a> (<i>Eichornia</i>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juncus" title="Juncus">rushes</a> (<i>Juncus</i>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phragmites" title="Phragmites">typical reeds</a> (<i>Phragmites</i>) or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattail" title="Cattail" class="mw-redirect">cattails</a> (<i>Typha</i>).

The Pinnated Bittern is largely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal" title="Nocturnal" class="mw-redirect">nocturnal</a>. Though generally solitary, it will gather in small loose groups at favored feeding areas. When frightened, it tends to freeze with its body crouched low and its head raised vertically just high enough to see. It typically flushes only at close range.
Estimates of its population, and of overall population trends, are unknown. Due to its wide range, it is nonetheless regarded a Species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern" title="Least Concern">Least Concern</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Its diet is varied,<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_1-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> consisting of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> (including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eel" title="Eel">eels</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile" title="Reptile">reptiles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian" title="Amphibian">amphibians</a>, chicks, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a> and small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a> (even including young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Marmoset" title="Common Marmoset" class="mw-redirect">Common Marmosets</a>, <i>Callithrix jacchus</i><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>), all of which are typically taken in ambush.<sup id="cite_ref-ss1989_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ss1989-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The Pinnated Bittern is a patient hunter, often standing motionless for long periods while waiting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation" title="Predation">prey</a> to move within range.
As typical for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botaurinae" title="Botaurinae" class="mw-redirect">Botaurinae</a> (but unlike most herons), the Pinnated Bittern is a solitary breeder. Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a>, a platform or shallow cup of rush stems or other plant material, is typically built among thick vegetation not far above the water surface. The female lays two to three olive-brown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>, and is thought to do all of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubation</a>. Pinnated Bitterns are almost exclusively <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season" title="Wet season">wet season</a> breeders.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
