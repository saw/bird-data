The <b>Grey Partridge</b> (<i>Perdix perdix</i>) also known as the <b>English Partridge</b>, <b>Hungarian Partridge</b>, or <b>Hun</b>, is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebird" title="Gamebird" class="mw-redirect">gamebird</a> in the pheasant family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasianidae" title="Phasianidae">Phasianidae</a> of the order <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galliformes" title="Galliformes">Galliformes</a>, gallinaceous birds. The species has been successfully introduced to many parts of the world for shooting, including vast areas of North America, where it is most commonly known as Hungarian partridge, or just "Hun". Widespread and common throughout its large range, the Grey Partridge is evaluated as Least Concern on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List</a> of Threatened Species. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partridge" title="Partridge">partridge</a> breeds on farmland across most of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> into western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, and has been introduced widely into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. They are quite common in some areas of southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>.
The Grey Partridge is a rotund bird, 28–32&nbsp;cm long, brown-backed, with grey flanks and chest. The belly is white, usually marked with a large chestnut-brown horse-shoe mark in males, and also in many females. Hens lay up to twenty eggs in a ground nest. The nest is usually in the margin of a cereal field, most commonly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_wheat" title="Winter wheat">Winter wheat</a>. The only major and constant difference between the sexes is the so-called cross of Lorraine on the tertiary coverts of females – these being marked with two transverse bars, as opposed to the one in males. These are present after around 16 weeks of age when the birds have moulted into adult plumage. Young Grey Partridges are mostly yellow-brown and lack the distinctive face and underpart markings. The song is a harsh <i>kieerr-ik</i>, and when disturbed, like most of the gamebirds, it flies a short distance on rounded wings, often calling <i>rick rick rick</i> as it rises. They are a seed-eating species, but the young in particular take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> as an essential <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a> supply. During the first 10 days of life, the young can only digest insects. The parents lead their chicks to the edges of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal" title="Cereal">cereal</a> fields, where they can forage for insects. They are also a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">non-migratory</a> terrestrial species, and form flocks outside the breeding season.
Though common and not threatened, it appears to be declining in numbers in some areas of intensive cultivation such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, probably due to a loss of breeding habitat and possibly food supplies. Their numbers have fallen in these areas by as much as 85% in the last 25 years. Efforts are being made in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> by organizations such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_%26_Wildlife_Conservation_Trust" title="Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust">Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust</a> to halt this decline by creating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_headland" title="Conservation headland">Conservation headlands</a>. In 1995 it was nominated a Biodiversity Action plan species.
