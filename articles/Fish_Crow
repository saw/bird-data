The <b>Fish Crow</b> (<i>Corvus ossifragus</i>) is a species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow" title="Crow">crow</a> that is associated with wetland habitats in the eastern and southeastern United States.
The Fish Crow was first described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Wilson" title="Alexander Wilson">Alexander Wilson</a> in 1812. The latest genetic testing now seems to indicate that this species is close to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinaloan_Crow" title="Sinaloan Crow" class="mw-redirect">Sinaloan Crow</a> (<i>Corvus sinaloae</i>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamaulipas_Crow" title="Tamaulipas Crow">Tamaulipas Crow</a> (<i>Corvus imparatus</i>), and not as close to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Crow" title="American Crow">American Crow</a> (<i>Corvus brachyrhynchos</i>) as outward signs would suggest.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from August 2011">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
The Fish Crow is superficially similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Crow" title="American Crow">American Crow</a> but is smaller (36â€“41&nbsp;cm in length) and has a more silky smooth plumage by comparison. The upperparts have a blue or blue-green sheen, while the underparts have a more greenish tint to the black. The eyes are dark brown. The differences are often only really apparent between the two species when side by side or, when heard calling. The bill is usually somewhat slimmer than the American Crow, but is only readily distinguishable if both species are seen together.<sup id="cite_ref-Good92_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Good92-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Visual differentiation from the American Crow is extremely difficult and often inaccurate.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows tend to have more slender bills and feet. There may also be a small sharp hook at the end of the upper bill. Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.
The voice is the most outwardly differing characteristic for this species and other American crow species. The call of the Fish Crow has been described as a nasal <i>"ark-ark-ark"</i> or a begging <i>"waw-waw"</i>. Birders often distinguish the two species (in areas where their range overlaps) with the mnemonic aid <i>"Just ask him if he is an American Crow. If he says</i> "no"<i>, he is a Fish Crow."</i> referring to the fact that the most common call of the American Crow is a distinct <i>"caw caw"</i>, while that of the Fish Crow is a nasal <i>"nyuh unh"</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species occurs on the eastern seaboard of the United States from the state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a> south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_West" title="Key West">Key West</a>, and west along the northern coastline of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> and follows many river systems inland for quite some distance. Coastal marshes and beaches are frequented, also rivers, inland lakes and marshes, river banks, and the land immediately surrounding all.<sup id="cite_ref-Good92_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Good92-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Food is taken mainly from the ground and even in shallow water where the bird will hover and pluck food items out of the water with its feet. The fish crow is omnivorous. It will feed on small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab" title="Crab">crabs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp" title="Shrimp">shrimps</a>, other invertebrates, stranded fish and live fish if the situation favors their capture, eggs and nestlings of birds, small reptiles, the fruits of many trees, peanuts and grains, as well as human scraps where available.<sup id="cite_ref-Good92_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Good92-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The nest is usually built high in a tree and is often accompanied in nearby trees with other nests of the same species forming small, loose colonies. There are usually 4-5 eggs laid. Pale blue-green in colour, they bear blotches of olive-brown.<sup id="cite_ref-Good93_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Good93-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species appears to be somewhat more resistant to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Nile_Virus" title="West Nile Virus" class="mw-redirect">West Nile Virus</a> than the American crow. Survival rates of up to 45% have been reported for fish crows, compared with near zero for the American species.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from August 2011">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
