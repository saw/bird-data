The <b>Wild Turkey</b> (<i>Meleagris gallopavo</i>) is native to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and is the heaviest member of the diverse <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galliformes" title="Galliformes">Galliformes</a>. It is the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_turkey" title="Domestic turkey" class="mw-redirect">domestic turkey</a>, which was originally derived from a southern Mexican <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> of Wild Turkey (not the related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocellated_Turkey" title="Ocellated Turkey">Ocellated Turkey</a>). Although native to North America, the Wild Turkey got its name due to the trade routes in place. During the 16th Century, the major trade route from the Americas and Asia required the goods to go to Constantinople in Turkey before being sent to Britain. The British at the time therefore, associated the Wild Turkey with the country Turkey and the name stuck. <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Adult wild turkeys have long reddish-yellow to grayish-green legs. The body feathers are generally blackish and dark brown overall with a coppery sheen that becomes more complex in adult males. Adult males, called toms or gobblers, have a large, featherless, reddish head, red throat, and red <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattle_(anatomy)" title="Wattle (anatomy)">wattles</a> on the throat and neck. The head has fleshy growths called caruncles. Juvenile males are called jakes, the difference between an adult male and a juvenile is that the jake has a very short beard and his tail fan has longer feathers in the middle. The adult male's tail fan will be all the same length.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> When males are excited, a fleshy flap on the bill expands, and this, the wattles and the bare skin of the head and neck all become engorged with blood, almost concealing the eyes and bill. The long fleshy object over a male's beak is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb_(anatomy)" title="Comb (anatomy)">snood</a>. When a male turkey is excited, its head turns blue; when ready to fight, it turns red. Each foot has three toes, and males have a spur behind each of their lower legs.
Male turkeys have a long, dark, fan-shaped tail and glossy bronze wings. As with many other species of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galliformes" title="Galliformes">Galliformes</a>, turkeys exhibit strong <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>. The male is substantially larger than the female, and his feathers have areas of red, purple, green, copper, bronze, and gold <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescent" title="Iridescent" class="mw-redirect">iridescence</a>. Females, called hens, have feathers that are duller overall, in shades of brown and gray. Parasites can dull coloration of both sexes; in males, coloration may serve as a signal of health.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The primary wing feathers have white bars. Turkeys have 5000 to 6000 feathers.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Tail feathers are of the same length in adults, different lengths in juveniles. Males typically have a "beard", a tuft of coarse hair (modified feathers) growing from the center of the breast. Beards average 230&nbsp;mm (9.1&nbsp;in) in length. In some populations, 10 to 20 percent of females have a beard, usually shorter and thinner than that of the male. The adult male (or "tom") normally weighs from 5 to 11 kg (11 to 24 lb) and measures 100–125 cm (39–49 in) in length. The adult female (or "hen") is typically much smaller at 2.5–5.4 kg (5.5–12 lb) and is 76 to 95 cm (30 to 37 in) long.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The wings are relatively small, as is typical of the galliform order, and the wingspan ranges from 1.25 to 1.44 m (4&nbsp;ft 1&nbsp;in to 4&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;in). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is only 20 to 21.4 cm (7.9 to 8.4 in). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is also relatively small, as adults measure 2 to 3.2 cm (0.79 to 1.3 in) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmen_(bird)" title="Culmen (bird)" class="mw-redirect">culmen</a> length.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> of the Wild Turkey is quite long and sturdy, measuring from 9.7 to 19.1 cm (3.8 to 7.5 in). The tail is also relatively long, ranging from 24.5 to 50.5 cm (9.6 to 19.9 in).<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> The record-sized adult male Wild Turkey, according to the National Wild Turkey Federation, weighed 16.85&nbsp;kg (37.1&nbsp;lb), with records of tom turkeys weighing over 13.8&nbsp;kg (30&nbsp;lb) uncommon but not rare.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> While it is usually rather lighter than the waterfowl, after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpeter_Swan" title="Trumpeter Swan">Trumpeter Swan</a>, the turkey has the second heaviest maximum weight of any North American bird.

Despite their weight, wild turkeys, unlike their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_turkey" title="Domestic turkey" class="mw-redirect">domestic counterparts</a>, are agile fliers. Their ideal habitat is an open woodland or savanna,<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> where they may fly beneath the canopy top and find perches. They usually fly close to the ground for no more than a quarter mile (400 m). Turkeys have many vocalizations: "gobbles," "clucks," "putts," "purrs," "yelps," "cutts," "whines," "cackles," and "kee-kees." In early spring, male turkeys, also called gobblers or toms, gobble to announce their presence to females and competing males. The gobble can carry for up to a mile. Males also emit a low-pitched "drumming" sound; produced by the movement of air in the air sack in the chest, similar to the booming of a prairie chicken. In addition they produce a sound known as the "spit" which is a sharp expulsion of air from this air sack. Hens "yelp" to let gobblers know their location. Gobblers often yelp in the manner of females, and hens can gobble, though they rarely do so. Immature males, called jakes, often yelp.
Wild turkeys are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore" title="Omnivore">omnivorous</a>, foraging on the ground or climbing shrubs and small trees to feed. They prefer eating hard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_(botany)" title="Mast (botany)">mast</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn" title="Acorn">acorns</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(fruit)" title="Nut (fruit)">nuts</a>, and various trees, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazel" title="Hazel">hazel</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut" title="Chestnut">chestnut</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hickory" title="Hickory">hickory</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyon_pine" title="Pinyon pine">pinyon pine</a> as well as various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry" title="Berry">berries</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniper" title="Juniper">juniper</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearberry" title="Bearberry">bearberry</a>, roots and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>.

Poults have been observed eating insects, berries, and seeds. Wild turkeys often feed in cow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasture" title="Pasture">pastures</a>, sometimes visit back yard bird feeders, and favor croplands after harvest to scavenge seed on the ground. Turkeys are also known to eat a wide variety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass" title="Grass">grasses</a>.
Turkey populations can reach large numbers in small areas because of their ability to forage for different types of food. Early morning and late afternoon are the desired times for eating.
Males are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamous" title="Polygamous" class="mw-redirect">polygamous</a>, mating with as many hens as they can. Male wild turkeys display for females by puffing out their feathers, spreading out their tails and dragging their wings. This behavior is most commonly referred to as strutting. Their heads and necks are colored brilliantly with red, blue and white. The color can change with the turkey's mood, with a solid white head and neck being the most excited. They use gobbling, drumming/booming and spitting as signs of social dominance, and to attract females. Courtship begins during the months of March and April, which is when turkeys are still flocked together in winter areas.
Males may be seen courting in groups, often with the dominant male gobbling, spreading their tail feathers (strutting), drumming/booming and spitting. In a study, the average dominant male that courted as part of a pair of males fathered six more eggs than males that courted alone. Genetic analysis of pairs of males courting together shows that they are close relatives, with half of their genetic material being identical. The theory behind the team-courtship is that the less dominant male would have a greater chance of passing along shared genetic material than if it were courting alone.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
When mating is finished, females search for nest sites. Nests are shallow dirt depressions engulfed with woody vegetation. Hens lay a clutch of 10–14 eggs, usually one per day. The eggs are incubated for at least 28 days. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poult" title="Poult" class="mw-redirect">poults</a> are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial" title="Precocial">precocial</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidifugous" title="Nidifugous">nidifugous</a>, leaving the nest in about 12–24 hours.

The range and numbers of the wild turkey had decreased at the beginning of the 20th century due to hunting and loss of habitat. Game managers estimate that the entire population of wild turkeys in the United States was as low as 30,000 in the early 20th century. By the 1940s, it was almost totally extirpated from Canada and barely hanging on in remote pockets of the United States. Game officials made efforts to protect and encourage the breeding of the surviving wild population. As wild turkey numbers rebounded, hunting was legalized in 49 U.S. states (excluding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>). In 1973 the total U.S. population was estimated to be 1.3 million, and current estimates place the entire wild turkey population at 7 million individuals. In recent years, "trap and transfer" projects have reintroduced wild turkeys to several provinces of Canada as well, sometimes from across the border in the United States.
There are subtle differences in the coloration, habitat, and behavior of the different subspecies of wild turkeys. The six subspecies are:
This was the turkey species first encountered in the wild by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritan" title="Puritan">Puritans</a>, the founders of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamestown,_Virginia" title="Jamestown, Virginia">Jamestown</a>, and the Acadians; its range is one of the largest of all subspecies. The natural range covers the entire eastern half of the United States from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine" title="Maine">Maine</a> in the north to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> and extending as far west as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>, and into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>.

They number from 5.1 to 5.3 million birds. They were first named 'forest turkey' in 1817, and can grow up to 4 feet (1.2&nbsp;m) tall. The upper tail coverts are tipped with chestnut brown. Males can reach 30 pounds (14&nbsp;kg) in weight. The Eastern Wild Turkey is heavily hunted in the Eastern USA and is the most hunted wild turkey subspecies.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> peninsula, they number from 80,000 to 100,000 birds. This bird is named for the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole" title="Seminole">Seminole</a> leader <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osceola" title="Osceola">Osceola</a>, and was first described in 1890. It is smaller and darker than the Eastern Wild Turkey. The wing feathers are very dark with smaller amounts of the white barring seen on other subspecies. Their overall body feathers are an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescent" title="Iridescent" class="mw-redirect">iridescent</a> green-purple color. They are often found in scrub patches of palmetto and occasionally near swamps, where amphibian prey is abundant.

A small population has been established in southern Arizona. Gould's are the largest of the five subspecies. They have longer legs, larger feet, and longer tail feathers. The main colors of the body feathers are copper and greenish-gold. This subspecies is heavily protected owing to its skittish nature and threatened status.
The South Mexican Wild Turkey is considered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominate_subspecies" title="Nominate subspecies" class="mw-redirect">nominate subspecies</a>, and the only one that is not found in the United States or Canada. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec" title="Aztec">Aztecs</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Mesoamerica" title="Agriculture in Mesoamerica">domesticated</a> the southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexican</a> subspecies, <i>M. g. gallopavo</i>, giving rise to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_turkey" title="Domestic turkey" class="mw-redirect">domestic turkey</a>. The Spaniards brought this tamed subspecies back to Europe with them in the mid-16th century; from Spain it spread to France and later Britain as a farmyard animal, usually becoming the centerpiece of a feast for the well-to-do. By 1620 it was common enough so that Pilgrim settlers of Massachusetts could bring turkeys with them from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, unaware that it had a larger close relative already occupying the forests of Massachusetts. It is one of the smallest subspecies and is best known in Spanish from its Aztec-derived name, <i>guajolote</i>. This wild turkey subspecies is thought to be critically endangered, as of 2010.

<i>With all this Injustice, he is never in good Case but like those among Men who live by Sharping &amp; Robbing he is generally poor and often very lousy.

He is therefore by no means a proper Emblem for the brave and honest Cincinnati of America who have driven all the King birds from our Country...</i>
<i>I am on this account not displeased that the Figure is not known as a Bald Eagle, but looks more like a Turkey. For in Truth the Turkey is in Comparison a much more respectable Bird, and withal a true original Native of America... He is besides, though a little vain &amp; silly, a Bird of Courage, and would not hesitate to attack a Grenadier of the British Guards who should presume to invade his Farm Yard with a red Coat on.</i>
Franklin never publicly voiced opposition to the Bald Eagle as a national symbol.<sup id="cite_ref-Heraldry_22-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Heraldry-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Wild Turkey, throughout its range, plays a significant role in the cultures of many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_tribe" title="Native American tribe" class="mw-redirect">Native American tribes</a> all over North America. Outside of the Thanksgiving feast, it is a favorite meal in Eastern tribes. Eastern Native American tribes consumed both the eggs and meat, sometimes turning the latter into a type of jerky to preserve it and make it last through cold weather.
