Adults have white underparts, though the rest of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> goes through a complex moulting process. The male has a long pointed tail (10 to 15&nbsp;cm) and a dark grey <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> crossed by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink" title="Pink">pink</a> band. In winter, the male has a dark cheek patch on a mainly white head and neck, a dark breast and mostly white body. In summer, the male is dark on the head, neck and back with a white cheek patch. The female has a brown back and a relatively short pointed tail. In winter, the female's head and neck are white with a dark crown. In summer, the head is dark. Juveniles resemble adult females in autumn plumage, though with a lighter, less distinct cheek patch.
Their breeding habitat is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a> pools and marshes, but also along sea coasts and in large mountain lakes in the North Atlantic region, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> is located on the ground near water; it is built using vegetation and lined with down. They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> and winter along the eastern and western coasts of North America, on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>, coastal northern Europe and Asia, with stragglers to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>. The most important wintering area is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, where a total of about 4.5 million gather.
The Long-tailed Duck is gregarious, forming large flocks in winter and during migration. They feed by diving for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusk" title="Mollusk" class="mw-redirect">mollusks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a> and some small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>. Although they usually feed close to the surface, they are capable of diving to depths of 60m (200&nbsp;feet).
In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_English" title="North American English">North American English</a> it is sometimes called <i>Oldsquaw</i>, though this name has fallen out of favour under influence of negative connotations of the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaw" title="Squaw">squaw</a> in English usage. Some biologists have also feared that this name would be offensive to some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples in the Americas" class="mw-redirect">Native American</a> tribes involved in the conservation effort.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The American Ornithologists' Union stated that "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness" title="Political correctness">political correctness</a>" was not sufficient to change the name, but "to conform with English usage in other parts of the world", it officially adopted the name <i>Long-tailed Duck</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The males are vocal and have a musical yodelling call <i>ow, ow, owal-ow</i>.
The Long-tailed Duck is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEWA" title="AEWA" class="mw-redirect">AEWA</a>) applies.
