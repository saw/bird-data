The <b>Arctic Tern</b> (<i>Sterna paradisaea</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">tern</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternidae" title="Sternidae" class="mw-redirect">Sternidae</a>. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> has a <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/circumpolar" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:circumpolar">circumpolar</a> breeding distribution covering the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> and sub-Arctic regions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> (as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_(administrative_region)" title="Brittany (administrative region)">Brittany</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> is strongly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, seeing two summers each year as it migrates from its northern breeding grounds along a winding route to the oceans around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> and back, a round trip of about 70,900&nbsp;km (c. 44,300 miles) each year.<sup id="cite_ref-Arctic_terns.27_flying_feat_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Arctic_terns.27_flying_feat-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> This is by far the longest regular migration by any known animal. The Arctic Tern flies as well as glides through the air, performing almost all of its tasks in the air. It nests once every one to three years (depending on its mating cycle); once it has finished nesting it takes to the sky for another long southern migration.
Arctic Terns are medium-sized birds. They have a length of 33–39&nbsp;cm (13–15&nbsp;in) and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingspan" title="Wingspan">wingspan</a> of 76–85&nbsp;cm (26–30&nbsp;in). They are mainly grey and white plumaged, with a red beak (as long as the head, straight, with pronounced <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gonys" class="extiw" title="wikt:gonys">gonys</a>) and feet, white forehead, a black nape and crown (streaked white), and white cheeks. The grey mantle is 305&nbsp;mm, and the scapulae are fringed brown, some tipped white. The upper wing is grey with a white leading edge, and the collar is completely white, as is the rump. The deeply forked tail is whitish, with grey outer webs. The hindcrown to the ear-coverts is black.
Arctic Terns are long-lived birds, with many reaching thirty years of age. They eat mainly fish and small marine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a>. The species is abundant, with an estimated one million individuals. While the trend in the number of individuals in the species as a whole is not known, exploitation in the past has reduced this bird's numbers in the southern reaches of its range.
The Arctic Tern has a worldwide, circumpolar breeding distribution which is continuous; there are no recognized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>. It can be found in coastal regions in cooler temperate parts of North America and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_hemisphere" title="Northern hemisphere" class="mw-redirect">northern</a> summer. While wintering during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_hemisphere" title="Southern hemisphere" class="mw-redirect">southern</a> summer, it can be found at sea, reaching the southern edge of the Antarctic ice.<sup id="cite_ref-RSPB_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RSPB-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Arctic Tern is famous for its migration; it flies from its Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctic and back again each year. This 19,000&nbsp;km (12,000&nbsp;mi) journey each way ensures that this bird sees two summers per year and more daylight than any other creature on the planet.<sup id="cite_ref-Cramp_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cramp-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> One example of this bird's remarkable long-distance flying abilities involves an Arctic Tern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_ringing" title="Bird ringing">ringed</a> as an unfledged chick on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farne_Islands" title="Farne Islands">Farne Islands</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumberland" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" title="UK" class="mw-redirect">UK</a>, in the northern summer of 1982, which reached <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, in October 1982, a sea journey of over 22,000&nbsp;km (14,000&nbsp;mi) in just three months from fledging.<sup id="cite_ref-Heavisides_et_al._6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Heavisides_et_al.-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Another example is that of a chick ringed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador" title="Labrador">Labrador</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, on 23 July 1928.

Research using tracking devices attached to the birds was published in January 2010 and showed that the above examples are in fact not unusual for the species; eleven Arctic Terns that bred in Greenland or Iceland each covered 70,900&nbsp;km on average in a year, with a maximum of 81,600&nbsp;km. The difference from previous estimates was because the birds were found to take a meandering course to take advantage of prevailing winds.<sup id="cite_ref-Arctic_terns.27_flying_feat_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Arctic_terns.27_flying_feat-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The average Arctic Tern lives about twenty years, and will travel about 2.4 million km (1.5 million mi).
Arctic Terns usually migrate far offshore.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Consequently, they are rarely seen from land outside the breeding season.
The Arctic Tern is a medium-sized bird around 33–36&nbsp;cm (13–15&nbsp;in) from the tip of its beak to the tip of its tail. The wingspan is 76–85&nbsp;cm.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The weight is 86–127&nbsp;g (3.0–4.5&nbsp;oz). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">beak</a> is dark red, as are the short legs and webbed feet. Like most terns, the Arctic Tern has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_flight" title="Bird flight">high aspect ratio wings</a> and a tail with a deep fork.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
The adult <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> is grey above, with a black nape and crown and white cheeks. The upperwings are pale grey, with the area near the wingtip being translucent. The tail is white, and the underparts pale grey. Both sexes are similar in appearance. The winter plumage is similar, but the crown is whiter and the bills are darker.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_8-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
Juveniles differ from adults in their black bill and legs, "scaly" appearing wings, and mantle with dark feather tips, dark carpal wing bar, and short tail streamers.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_8-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> During their first summer, juveniles also have a whiter forecrown.<sup id="cite_ref-National_Geographic_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-National_Geographic-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
The species has a variety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_call" title="Bird call" class="mw-redirect">calls</a>; the two most common being the <i>alarm call</i>, made when possible predators (such as humans or other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>) enter the colonies, and the <i>advertising call</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Hatch_et_al._10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hatch_et_al.-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The advertising call is social in nature, made when returning to the colony and during aggressive encounters between individuals. It is unique to each individual tern and as such it serves a similar role to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_song" title="Bird song" class="mw-redirect">bird song</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerines</a>, identifying individuals. Eight other calls have been described, from <i>begging calls</i> made by females during mating to <i>attack calls</i> made while swooping at intruders.
While the Arctic Tern is similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Tern" title="Common Tern">Common</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseate_Tern" title="Roseate Tern">Roseate Terns</a>, its colouring, profile, and call are slightly different. Compared to the Common Tern, it has a longer tail and mono-coloured bill, while the main differences from the Roseate are its slightly darker colour and longer wings. The Arctic Tern's call is more nasal and rasping than that of the Common, and is easily distinguishable from that of the Roseate.<sup id="cite_ref-Olsen_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Olsen-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
This bird's closest relatives are a group of South Polar species, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_American_Tern" title="South American Tern">South American</a> (<i>Sterna hirundinacea</i>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerguelen_Tern" title="Kerguelen Tern">Kerguelen</a> (<i>S. virgata</i>), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Tern" title="Antarctic Tern">Antarctic</a> (<i>S. vittata</i>) Terns.<sup id="cite_ref-Bridge_et_al._12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bridge_et_al.-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> On the wintering grounds, the Arctic Tern can be distinguished from these relatives; the six-month difference in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moult" title="Moult" class="mw-redirect">moult</a> is the best clue here, with Arctic Terns being in winter plumage during the southern summer. The southern species also do not show darker wingtips in flight.
The immature plumages of Arctic Tern were originally described as separate species, <i>Sterna portlandica</i> and <i>Sterna pikei</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
Breeding begins around the third or fourth year.<sup id="cite_ref-Hawksley_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hawksley-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Arctic Terns mate for life, and in most cases, return to the same colony each year.<sup id="cite_ref-Firefly_p_267_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Firefly_p_267-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship#Courtship_in_the_animal_kingdom" title="Courtship">Courtship</a> is elaborate, especially in birds nesting for the first time.<sup id="cite_ref-Firefly_p_268_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Firefly_p_268-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> Courtship begins with a so-called "high flight", where a female will chase the male to a high altitude and then slowly descend. This display is followed by "fish flights", where the male will offer fish to the female. Courtship on the ground involves strutting with a raised tail and lowered wings. After this, both birds will usually fly and circle each other.<sup id="cite_ref-Firefly_p_268_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Firefly_p_268-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
Both sexes agree on a site for a nest, and both will defend the site. During this time, the male continues to feed the female. Mating occurs shortly after this.<sup id="cite_ref-Firefly_p_268_16-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Firefly_p_268-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> Breeding takes place in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird_colony" title="Seabird colony" class="mw-redirect">colonies</a> on coasts, islands and occasionally inland on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a> near water. It often forms mixed flocks with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Tern" title="Common Tern">Common Tern</a>. It lays from one to three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> per clutch, most often two.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_8-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
It is one of the most aggressive terns, fiercely defensive of its nest and young. It will attack humans and large predators, usually striking the top or back of the head. Although it is too small to cause serious injury to an animal of a human's size, it is still capable of drawing blood, and is capable of repelling many raptorial birds and smaller mammalian predators such as foxes and cats.<sup id="cite_ref-Cramp_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cramp-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Other nesting birds, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcid" title="Alcid" class="mw-redirect">alcids</a>, often incidentally benefit from the protection provided by nesting in an area defended by Arctic Terns.
The nest is usually a depression in the ground, which may or may not be lined with bits of grass or similar materials. The eggs are mottled and camouflaged.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_8-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBW-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Both sexes share incubation duties.
