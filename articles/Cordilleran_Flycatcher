The <b>Cordilleran Flycatcher</b> (<i>Empidonax occidentalis</i>) is a small insect-eating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a>.

Adults have olive-gray upperparts, darker on the wings and tail, with yellowish underparts; they have a conspicuous teardrop-shaped white eye ring, white wing bars, a small bill and a short tail. Many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> look closely alike. The best ways to distinguish species are by voice, by breeding habitat, and by range. This bird is virtually identical to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific-slope_Flycatcher" title="Pacific-slope Flycatcher">Pacific-slope Flycatcher</a>. These two species were formerly considered a single species known as <b>Western Flycatcher</b>.

They have different songs and calls.
Cordilleran Flycatchers' preferred breeding habitat is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine" title="Pine">pine</a>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak" title="Oak">oak</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coniferous" title="Coniferous" class="mw-redirect">coniferous</a> forest, usually near running water. They make a cup nest on a fork in a tree, usually low in a horizontal branch. Females usually lay 2–5 eggs.
These birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> for the winter, where the Mexican central-southern birds are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_bird" title="Resident bird" class="mw-redirect">resident</a>. The non-resident birds are on the western coast from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalisco" title="Jalisco">Jalisco</a> northwards, and then to inland regions, in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_corridor" title="Wildlife corridor">corridor strip</a> on the western flank of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_Occidental" title="Sierra Madre Occidental">Sierra Madre Occidental</a>.
The Cordilleran Flycatcher waits on an open perch of a shrub or low branch of a tree and flies out to catch insects in flight (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_(birds)" title="Hawking (birds)">hawking</a>), and also sometimes picks insects from foliage while hovering (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleaning_(birds)" title="Gleaning (birds)">gleaning</a>).
The song includes notes represented as <i>pseet</i>, <i>ptsick</i>, <i>seet</i> usually sung rapidly together. The <i>ptsick</i> or <i>ptik</i> note has the first syllable higher-pitched than the second—the only difference from the Pacific-slope Flycatcher's song (Sibley 2000). The male's typical position call is a loud and distinctive <i>pit pete</i><sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from June 2008">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> or <i>tse-seet</i>, but some give a "rising <i>tsweep</i>" or a "slurred <i>tseeweep</i>, like the calls of Pacific-slope Flycatchers (Sibley 2000).
