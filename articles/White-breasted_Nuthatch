The <b>White-breasted Nuthatch</b> (<i>Sitta carolinensis</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuthatch" title="Nuthatch">nuthatch</a> family which breeds in old-growth woodland across much of temperate North America. It is a stocky bird, with a large head, short tail, powerful bill and strong feet. The upperparts are pale blue-gray, and the face and underparts are white. It has a black cap and a chestnut lower belly. The nine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> differ mainly in the color of the body <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a>.
Like other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuthatch" title="Nuthatch">nuthatches</a>, the White-breasted Nuthatch forages for insects on trunks and branches, and is able to move head-first down trees. Seeds form a substantial part of its winter diet, as do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn" title="Acorn">acorns</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hickory" title="Hickory">hickory</a> nuts that were stored by the bird in the fall. The nest is in a hole in a tree, and the breeding pair may smear insects around the entrance as a deterrent to squirrels. Adults and young may be killed by hawks, owls and snakes, and forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss, but this is a common species with no major conservation concerns over most of its range.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuthatch" title="Nuthatch">nuthatches</a> are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a>, <i>Sitta</i>, of small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a> which derive their English name from the propensity of some species to wedge large insects or seeds into cracks, and then hack at them with their strong bills.<sup id="cite_ref-dict_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dict-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>Sitta</i> is derived from <i>sittē</i>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> for nuthatch,<sup id="cite_ref-Chambers_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Chambers-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> and <i>carolinensis</i> means "of Carolina" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a>. The White-breasted Nuthatch was first described by English ornithologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Latham_(ornithologist)" title="John Latham (ornithologist)">John Latham</a> in his 1790 work, the <i>Index Ornithologicus</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Latham_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Latham-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
Nuthatch taxonomy is complex, with geographically separated species sometimes closely resembling each other. The White-breasted Nuthatch has a similar appearance and contact call to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-cheeked_Nuthatch" title="White-cheeked Nuthatch">White-cheeked Nuthatch</a>, <i>Sitta leucopsis</i>, of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> and was formerly considered to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecificity" title="Conspecificity">conspecific</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrap_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrap-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Like other members of its genus, the White-breasted Nuthatch has a large head, short tail, short wings, a powerful bill and strong feet; it is 13–14&nbsp;cm (5–6&nbsp;in) long, with a wingspan of 20–27&nbsp;cm (8–11&nbsp;in) and a weight of 18–30&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram" title="Gram">g</a> (0.64–1.06&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce" title="Ounce">oz)</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The adult male of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies#Nomenclature" title="Subspecies">nominate subspecies</a>, <i>S. c. carolinensis</i>, has pale blue-gray upperparts, a glossy black cap (crown of the head), and a black band on the upper back. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_(feather)" title="Covert (feather)" class="mw-redirect">wing coverts</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">flight feathers</a> are very dark gray with paler fringes, and the closed wing is pale gray and black, with a thin white wing bar. The face and the underparts are white. The outer tail feathers are black with broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers, a feature readily visible in flight.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrap_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrap-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The female has, on average, a narrower black back band, slightly duller upperparts and buffer underparts than the male. Her cap may be gray, but many females have black caps, and cannot be reliably distinguished from the male in the field. In the northeastern United States, at least 10% of females have black caps, but the proportion rises to 40–80% in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, Mexico and the southeastern U.S. Juveniles are similar to the adult, but duller plumaged.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrap_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrap-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Like other nuthatches, this is a noisy species with a range of vocalizations. The male's mating song is a rapid nasal <i>qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui</i>. The contact call between members of a pair, given most frequently in the fall and winter is a thin squeaky <i>nit</i>, uttered up to 30 times a minute. A more distinctive sound is a shrill <i>kri</i> repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement <i>kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri</i>; the Rocky Mountains and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Basin" title="Great Basin">Great Basin</a> subspecies have a higher, faster <i>yididitititit</i> call,<sup id="cite_ref-Harrap_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrap-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> and Pacific birds a more nasal <i>beeerf</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Sibley_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sibley-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
Three other, significantly smaller, nuthatches have ranges which overlap that of White-breasted, but none has white plumage completely surrounding the eye. Further distinctions are that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-breasted_Nuthatch" title="Red-breasted Nuthatch">Red-breasted Nuthatch</a> has a black eye line and reddish underparts, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-headed_Nuthatch" title="Brown-headed Nuthatch">Brown-headed</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmy_Nuthatch" title="Pygmy Nuthatch">Pygmy Nuthatches</a> each have a brown cap, and a white patch on the nape of the neck.<sup id="cite_ref-Sibley_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sibley-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The White-breasted Nuthatch has nine subspecies, although the differences are small and change gradually across the range. The subspecies are sometimes treated as three groups based on close similarities in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphology</a>, habitat usage, and vocalizations. These groups cover eastern North America, the Great Basin and central Mexico, and the Pacific coastal regions.<sup id="cite_ref-Sibley_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sibley-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The subspecies of the western interior have the darkest upperparts, and eastern <i>S. c. carolinensis</i> has the palest back.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrap_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrap-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The eastern form also has a thicker bill and broader dark cap stripe than the interior and Pacific races. The calls of the three groups differ, as described above.<sup id="cite_ref-Sibley_7-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sibley-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The Great Basin and Eastern forms have been observed in secondary contact on the Great Plains, where they do not seem to mix.
The breeding habitat of the White-breasted Nuthatch is woodland across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, from southern Canada to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> and southern Mexico. In the eastern part of its range, its preferred habitat is old-growth open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> or mixed forest, including orchards, parks, suburban gardens and cemeteries; it is found mainly in the lowlands, although it breeds at 1,675&nbsp;m (5,500&nbsp;ft) altitude in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>. In the west and Mexico, this nuthatch is found in open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montane_forest" title="Montane forest" class="mw-redirect">montane</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine" title="Pine">pine</a>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak" title="Oak">oak</a> woodlands, and nesting occurs at up to 3,200&nbsp;m (10,500&nbsp;ft) altitude in Nevada, California and Mexico.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrap_2-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrap-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyon_pine" title="Pinyon pine">Pinyon</a>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniper" title="Juniper">juniper</a> and riverside woodlands may be used locally where available.<sup id="cite_ref-Ryser_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ryser-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The White-breasted Nuthatch is the only North American nuthatch usually found in deciduous trees; Red-breasted, Pygmy and Brown-headed Nuthatches prefer pines.<sup id="cite_ref-Sibley_7-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sibley-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The presence of mature or decaying trees with holes suitable for nesting is essential, and trees such as oak, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beech" title="Beech">beech</a> and hickory are favored in the east since they provide edible seeds.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrap_2-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrap-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Although suitable habitat is distributed continentally, it is discontinuous, and the separate populations of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">non-migratory</a> species have diverged to form distinct regional subspecies.<sup id="cite_ref-Spellman_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Spellman-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
This nuthatch, like most of its genus, is non-migratory, and the adults normally stay in their territory year-round. There may be more noticeable dispersal due to seed failure or high reproductive success in some years,<sup id="cite_ref-Fergus_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fergus-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> and this species has occurred as a vagrant to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Island" title="Vancouver Island">Vancouver Island</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Island" title="Santa Cruz Island">Santa Cruz Island</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. One bird landed on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Queen_Mary" title="RMS Queen Mary">RMS <i>Queen Mary</i></a> six hours sailing east of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> in October 1963.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrap_2-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrap-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The White-breasted Nuthatch is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy" title="Monogamy">monogamous</a>, and pairs form following a courtship in which the male bows to the female, spreading his tail and drooping his wings while swaying back and forth; he also feeds her morsels of food.<sup id="cite_ref-Fergus_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fergus-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The pair establish a territory of 0.10–0.15&nbsp;square kilometers (25–38&nbsp;acres) in woodland, and up to 0.2&nbsp;square kilometers (50&nbsp;acres) in semi-wooded habitats, and then remain together year-round until one partner dies or disappears.<sup id="cite_ref-ADWwbn_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADWwbn-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> The nest cavity is usually a natural hole in a decaying tree, sometimes an old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> nest.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrap_2-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrap-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The nest hole is usually 3–12&nbsp;m (10–40&nbsp;ft) high in a tree and is lined with fur, fine grass, and shredded bark. The clutch is five to nine eggs which are creamy-white, speckled with reddish brown, and average 19&nbsp;x&nbsp;14&nbsp;mm (0.75&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.55&nbsp;in) in size. The eggs are incubated by the female for 13 to 14&nbsp;days prior to hatching, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" title="Altricial">altricial</a> chicks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> in a further 18 to 26&nbsp;days.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Both adults feed the chicks in the nest and for about two weeks after fledging, and the male also feeds the female while she is incubating. Once independent, juveniles leave the adults' territory and either establish their own territory or become "floaters", unpaired without territories. It is probably these floaters which are mainly involved in the irregular dispersals of this species. This species of nuthatch roosts in tree holes or behind loose bark when not breeding, and has the unusual habit of removing its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faeces" title="Faeces" class="mw-redirect">faeces</a> from the roost site in the morning. It usually roosts alone except in very cold weather, when up to 29&nbsp;birds have been recorded together.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrap_2-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrap-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Predators of adult nuthatches include owls and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnality" title="Diurnality">diurnal</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">birds of prey</a> (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp-shinned_Hawk" title="Sharp-shinned Hawk">Sharp-shinned</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper%27s_Hawk" title="Cooper's Hawk">Cooper's Hawks</a>), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel" title="Squirrel">squirrels</a>, and climbing snakes such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_Green_Snake" title="Smooth Green Snake" class="mw-redirect">Smooth Green Snake</a>. The White-breasted Nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making <i>hn-hn</i> calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell.<sup id="cite_ref-ADWwbn_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADWwbn-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> The nuthatch may also smear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blister_beetle" title="Blister beetle">blister beetles</a> around the entrance to its nest, and it has been suggested that the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel" title="Squirrel">squirrels</a>, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.<sup id="cite_ref-Kilham_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kilham-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years,<sup id="cite_ref-ADWwbn_11-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADWwbn-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> but the record is twelve years and nine months.<sup id="cite_ref-Fergus_10-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fergus-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
This nuthatch's responses to predators may be linked to a reproductive strategy. A study compared the White-breasted Nuthatch with the Red-breasted Nuthatch in terms of the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators. The models were of a Sharp-shinned Hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Wren" title="House Wren">House Wren</a>, which destroys eggs.<sup id="cite_ref-Ghalambor_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ghalambor-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> The White-breasted Nuthatch is shorter-lived than the Red-breasted Nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the Red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities, while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.<sup id="cite_ref-Ghalambor_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ghalambor-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
The White-breasted Nuthatch forages along tree trunks and branches in a similar way to woodpeckers and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certhia" title="Certhia">treecreepers</a>, but does not use its tail for additional support, instead progressing in jerky hops using its strong legs and feet. All nuthatches are distinctive when seeking food because they are able to descend tree trunks head-first and can hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches.<sup id="cite_ref-Matthysen_.26_L.C3.B6hrl_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Matthysen_.26_L.C3.B6hrl-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
This nuthatch is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivorous" title="Omnivorous" class="mw-redirect">omnivorous</a>, eating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and seeds. It places large food items such as acorns or hickory nuts in crevices in tree trunks, and then hammers them open with its strong beak; surplus seeds are cached under loose bark or crevices of trees.<sup id="cite_ref-Fergus_10-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fergus-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The diet in winter may be nearly 70% seeds, but in summer it is mainly insects. The insects consumed by the White-breasted Nuthatch include caterpillars, ants, and pest species such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylobius_abietis" title="Hylobius abietis">pine weevils</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepidosaphes_ulmi" title="Lepidosaphes ulmi">oystershell</a> and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_insect" title="Scale insect">scale insects</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_plant_louse" title="Jumping plant louse">jumping plant lice</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-ADWwbn_11-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADWwbn-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hamid_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hamid-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Leslie_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Leslie-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> This bird will occasionally feed on the ground, and readily visits feeding stations for nuts, suet and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower" title="Sunflower">sunflower</a> seeds, the last of which it often takes away to store.<sup id="cite_ref-Fergus_10-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fergus-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
The White-breasted Nuthatch often travels with small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-species_feeding_flock" title="Mixed-species feeding flock" class="mw-redirect">mixed flocks</a> in winter. These flocks are led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_(bird)" title="Tit (bird)">titmice and chickadees</a>, with nuthatches and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downy_Woodpecker" title="Downy Woodpecker">Downy Woodpeckers</a> as common attendant species. Participants in such flocks are thought to benefit in terms of foraging and predator avoidance. It is likely that the attendant species also access the information carried in the chickadees' calls and reduce their own level of vigilance accordingly.<sup id="cite_ref-Dolby_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dolby-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>
The White-breasted Nuthatch is a common species with a large range, estimated at 8.6&nbsp;million square kilometers (3.3&nbsp;million square miles). Its total population is estimated at 10 million individuals, and there is evidence of an overall population increase, so it is not believed to approach either the size criterion (fewer than 10,000&nbsp;mature individuals) or the population decline criterion (declining more than 30%&nbsp;in ten years or three generations) of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List</a>.

The removal of dead trees from forests may cause problems locally for this species because it requires cavity sites for nesting; declines have been noted in Washington, Florida, and more widely in the southeastern U.S. west to Texas.
