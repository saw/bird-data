The <b>Eastern Towhee</b> (<i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_sparrow" title="American sparrow">New World sparrow</a>. The taxonomy of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towhee" title="Towhee">towhees</a> has been under debate in recent decades, and formerly this bird and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_Towhee" title="Spotted Towhee">Spotted Towhee</a> were considered a single species, the <b>Rufous-sided Towhee</b>.
Their breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_(ecology)" title="Habitat (ecology)" class="mw-redirect">habitat</a> is brushy areas across eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. They nest either low in bushes or on the ground under shrubs. Northern birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to the southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. There has been one record of this species as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrancy_(biology)#In_birds" title="Vagrancy (biology)">vagrant</a> to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>; a single bird in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> in 1966.
The song is a short <i>Drink your teeeeea</i> lasting around one second, starting with a sharp call ("drink!") and ending with a short trill "teeeeea". The name "towhee" is onomatopoeic description of one of the towhee's most common calls, a short two-part call rising in pitch and sometimes also called a "chewink" call.<sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Eastern Towhee is a large and striking species of sparrow. The total length ranges from 17.3 to 23 cm (6.8 to 9.1 in) and the wingspan is 20–30 cm (7.9–12 in).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The body of mass of this species ranges from 32 to 53 g (1.1 to 1.9 oz), with an average of 40&nbsp;g (1.4&nbsp;oz).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Adults have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufous" title="Rufous">rufous</a> sides, a white belly and a long dark tail with white edges. The eyes are red, white for birds in the southeast. Males have a black head, upper body and tail; these parts are brown in the female. Juveniles are brown overall. Eastern towhees of all ages and both sexes are generally unmistakable and are not known to co-exist with the similar western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_Towhee" title="Spotted Towhee">Spotted Towhee</a>.
The eastern towhee occurs throughout the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_United_States" title="Eastern United States">eastern United States</a> and south-east Canada. Occurrences from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, South-west Ontario and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>, and west to eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> are noted in a literature review. Populations north of southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a> through northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana" title="Indiana">Indiana</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a> to southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa" title="Iowa">Iowa</a> are primarily summer residents.<sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
<i>Pipilo e. erythrophthalmus</i> occurs in the most northerly part of the eastern towhee's distribution in the summer, and migrates to the southern and eastern portion of the species' range in the winter. The other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> are largely residents.<sup id="cite_ref-r69_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r69-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>Pipilo e. canaster</i> occurs from south-central Louisiana, north to northeastern Louisiana east through Mississippi, extreme southwestern Tennessee, northern Alabama and Georgia, central South Carolina to western North Carolina, and south to northwestern Florida and east along the Gulf Coast.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The range of <i>P. e. rileyi</i> extends from northern Florida through southern Georgia and coastal South Carolina to east-central North Carolina. <i>Pipilo e. alleni</i> occurs in peninsular Florida.<sup id="cite_ref-r69_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r69-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eastern towhee occurs in vegetation of disturbed areas, such as old-field successional vegetation and shrubby areas of power line right-of-ways. In northwestern Arkansas, eastern towhees occurred in old-field vegetation where dwarf sumac (<i>Rhus copallina</i>) occurred at a frequency of 28.6%, winged elm (<i>Ulmus alata</i>) at a frequency of 21%, and black cherry (<i>Prunus serotina</i>) at a frequency of 19.2%.<sup id="cite_ref-r7_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r7-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Shrubby vegetation along power lines is commonly used by eastern towhees.<sup id="cite_ref-r37_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r37-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> For example in Maryland, eastern towhee territories along a power line right-of-way corresponded with shrubby areas containing species such as Allegheny blackberry (<i>Rubus allegheniensis</i>) and blueberry (<i>Vaccinium</i> spp.). Other species included hawthorn (<i>Crataegus</i> spp.), red maple (<i>Acer rubrum</i>), black cherry, and black locust (<i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-r37_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r37-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
Arrival and departure of eastern towhees into summer breeding grounds varies with location. According to a literature review, eastern towhees typically arrive in New York in early April and leave by the middle of November. A review of eastern towhee in New Hampshire describes arrival in late April to May with the majority of eastern towhees departing in September.<sup id="cite_ref-r34_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r34-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Further south, on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, migration to high-elevation areas within the Great Smoky Mountains begins as early as March. Eastern towhees typically leave these sites in October.<sup id="cite_ref-r88_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r88-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> The <i>Pipilo e. erythrophthalmus</i> subspecies is the most migratory of the subspecies.<sup id="cite_ref-r69_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r69-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
Breeding begins in spring and continues to late summer. Reports of eastern towhees nesting as early as late March in Florida and Georgia, in mid- to late April in some midwestern states, and as late as mid-May in northern New England were summarized in a literature review.<sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Literature reviews also report nest construction by the female, which takes about 3 to 5 days.<sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r34_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r34-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Egg laying typically occurs until August. For example, a review of eastern towhee in Indiana notes nesting from 15 April to 20 August.<sup id="cite_ref-r67_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r67-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> However, a literature review of eastern towhee in Florida included a report of an eastern towhee nest observed on 2 September 1983 that contained 2 eggs.<sup id="cite_ref-r86_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r86-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> According to several literature reviews, eastern towhees may renest after failed nesting attempts and can raise 2, and in the south sometimes 3, broods per season.<sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r34_10-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r34-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r86_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r86-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
In a literature review, Greenlaw <sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> reports mean breeding territory size of 4 acres (1.6 ha) (range 1.6–6 acres (0.64–2.44 ha), n=24) in a mesic oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.) forest where eastern towhees occurred at a density of 21 males/40 ha. In a xeric pine (<i>Pinus</i> spp.)-oak woodland where eastern towhee density was 32 males/40 ha, mean eastern towhee territory size was 3 acres (1.2 ha) (range 1.8–4 acres (0.71–1.65 ha), n=20).<sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> In Massachusetts, mean male eastern towhee territory size was about 1.3 acres (0.52 ha), and female eastern towhee territory size was 1.1 acres (0.45 ha). Territory size changed over the course of the breeding season and was not significantly (p&gt;0.05) affected by reductions in food availability of 30% or less. During the winter eastern towhees are not as territorial and may be seen in mixed species flocks.<sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Daily movement of eastern towhees in loblolly (P. taeda) and longleaf pine (P. palustris) forests and clearcuts in South Carolina averaged 325 feet (99 m) per day.

Eastern towhees have fairly strong fidelity to breeding territories. In an oak forest in New Jersey, adult eastern towhee return rates were 20% the 1st year after banding and 43% in subsequent years. Between 1960 and 1967, the maximum number of eastern towhee returns to the site was 5.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> In a Pennsylvania woodlot observed between 1962 and 1967, an eastern towhee returned to the site for 4 consecutive years.<sup id="cite_ref-r79_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r79-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
Several reviews report eastern towhee clutch sizes from 2 to 6 eggs, with means ranging from 2.45 to 3.6 eggs per nest.<sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r34_10-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r34-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r67_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r67-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r86_13-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r86-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> All 5 eastern towhee nests on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanibel_Island" title="Sanibel Island">Sanibel Island</a>, Florida, contained 3 eggs.<sup id="cite_ref-r74_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r74-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> Eastern towhees in 2 pitch pine (<i>P. rigida</i>) barrens sites in New Jersey and New York had a later median egg laying date (mid-June) and significantly (p&lt;0.05) smaller average early nest clutch sizes (NJ=2.67, NY=3.25) than those in an oak-hickory (<i>Carya</i> spp.) site, which had a median egg-laying date in early June and an average early nest clutch size of 3.88. Food availability likely explains at least some of the differences between the 2 habitat types. Eggs are incubated by the female for 12 or 13 days. After hatching both parents feed the young, which fledge 10 to 12 days later and are dependent on parental care for about another month.<sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r34_10-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r34-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r67_12-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r67-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r86_13-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r86-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
A wide range of eastern towhee nest success values have been reported. On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanibel_Island" title="Sanibel Island">Sanibel Island</a>, 1 of the 5 eastern towhee nests observed was successful. In Louisiana, average daily nest success rate was 95.3% on a bottomland hardwood forest site. The same study found a 92.6% average daily nest success rate in a 6-year-old managed cottonwood (<i>Populus</i> spp.) plantation in Alabama. Average eastern towhee nest success across mixed bigtooth (<i>P. grandidentata</i>) and quaking aspen (<i>P. tremuloides</i>) stands of varying ages in Pennsylvania was 48.1%.<sup id="cite_ref-r103_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r103-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> In South Carolina, only 1 of 10 nests was successful, and the mean daily nest survival rate was 62.9%. This low value was explained by high levels of predation. Due to lower nest success rates of Bachman's sparrow (<i>Aimophila aestivalis</i>) than the previous year, it is suggested that eastern towhee nest success may have been measured during a comparatively poor year.<sup id="cite_ref-r52_14-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r52-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
Compared to nests, adult towhee survival rates are high. Average weekly adult survival rate of eastern towhees in a South Carolina study area was 99.3%. This rate was obtained from radio-marked eastern towhees and represented the pooled survival of both sexes and from 2 South Carolina sites, young and mature stands of loblolly and longleaf pine.<sup id="cite_ref-r52_14-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r52-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Between 1962 and 1967 in Pennsylvania, annual survival of breeding eastern towhees calculated from mistnetting recaptures was 58%.<sup id="cite_ref-r79_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r79-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> According to a literature review, both males and females become reproductively mature in their 2nd year.<sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Eastern towhees of over 12 years old have been reported in the wild.<sup id="cite_ref-r51_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r51-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eastern towhees range from near sea level to as high as 6,500&nbsp;ft (1,980 m) along the border of Tennessee and North Carolina during the summer.<sup id="cite_ref-r88_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r88-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> A literature review reports eastern towhees up to 3,000 feet (900 m) in New Hampshire.<sup id="cite_ref-r34_10-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r34-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eastern towhees spend the majority of their time near the ground. For instance, in Pennsylvania in spring, observations of eastern towhees below 3 feet (1 m) from the ground occurred significantly (p&lt;0.05) more than expected based on random spatial distribution, and observations above 3 feet (1 m) occurred significantly (p&lt;0.05) less than would be expected.<sup id="cite_ref-r102_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r102-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> In a Louisiana bottomland forest 62% of eastern towhee observations were within 2 feet (0.6 m) of the ground, and only 4% were observed above 25 feet (7.6 m). In the spring this changed, with detections of eastern towhees below 25 feet (7.6 m) declining from 70% to 65% and detections in the canopy (&gt;25&nbsp;ft (&gt;7.6 m)) increasing from 4% to 7%.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eastern towhees occur in many habitats, from tallgrass prairies and marshes to mature forests.<sup id="cite_ref-r52_14-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r52-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> However, eastern towhees are most common in early successional stands, habitat edges, and areas with similar vegetation structure throughout eastern forests.
In most communities eastern towhees are more abundant in young successional stands. Several studies found increased eastern towhee abundance on early successional sites compared to later-successional sites.<sup id="cite_ref-r102_20-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r102-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r28_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r28-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r49_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r49-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r56_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r56-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> Mean number of breeding eastern towhees (0.70 bird/50-m radius) and nest success rate (58%) were higher in a 15-year-old clearcut in West Virginia, than in other treatments, including a stand of yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), black cherry, red maple, sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and white ash (Fraxinus americana) that was not harvested.<sup id="cite_ref-r28_22-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r28-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> In a southern Missouri oak-hickory forest, eastern towhees were not present before clearcutting or in the nearby uncut forest after cutting, but occurred at a mean density of 9.3 birds/10 ha in a 3-year-old clearcut. A study of stands of varying ages in central New York found that eastern towhee density peaked in early successional stands.<sup id="cite_ref-r49_23-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r49-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>
Although eastern towhees generally prefer young successional sites, variation between habitat types and years has been observed. Krementz and Powell <sup id="cite_ref-r52_14-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r52-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> found higher relative abundance of eastern towhee in young (2–6 years old) stands of loblolly and longleaf pine than mature (32–98 years old) stands when investigated in 1995. However, in stands compared in 1996, the 95% confidence intervals of eastern towhee relative abundance on the 2 sites had a substantial degree of overlap. The degree to which eastern towhee responds to succession is influenced by habitat. For example, in Pennsylvania there was a significant (p&lt;0.05) difference between eastern towhee densities (number/10 ha) between mature mixed-oak forest and stands that had been clearcut about 5 years previously. However, eastern towhee densities did not differ significantly between a 1-year old mixed aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides, P. grandidentata</i>) clearcut, a 5-year old aspen clearcut, and a mature aspen stand.<sup id="cite_ref-r101_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r101-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> Eastern towhee abundance has been shown to peak at different times in different habitats. For instance, although in central hardwood forests eastern towhees were most abundant in regenerating stands, in loblolly and shortleaf pine forest they were most common in pole timber and mature stands. In addition, Bell and Whitmore concluded that early successional is likely too broad of a term for describing optimal towhee habitat, since high density of small trees was negatively associated with eastern towhee density in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia.<sup id="cite_ref-r8_26-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r8-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eastern towhees seem to prefer sites with characteristics generally associated with early successional vegetation, such as low canopy cover and dense understory. Negative correlations between eastern towhee abundance and various measurements of overstory density have been found in several studies.<sup id="cite_ref-r7_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r7-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r101_25-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r101-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> Average density of eastern towhees across 6 habitat types in Pennsylvania was significantly (p&lt;0.05) negatively correlated with density of overstory trees and basal area of overstory trees.<sup id="cite_ref-r101_25-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r101-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> Number of eastern towhees in a western Virginia hardwood forest was also significantly (p&lt;0.05) inversely correlated with total percent canopy cover. In a loblolly pine forest in South Carolina, the average number of eastern towhee breeding territories per experimental unit was significantly (p≤0.008) negatively correlated with mid-story (10–46 feet (3–14 m)) pine (<i>Pinus</i> spp.) and deciduous volume.<sup id="cite_ref-r59_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r59-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup>
Many studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between eastern towhee abundance and understory density. In a loblolly pine forest in South Carolina, understory (0–10&nbsp;ft (0–3 m)) pine volume was significantly (p&lt;0.001) positively correlated with the average number of eastern towhee territories per experimental unit.<sup id="cite_ref-r59_27-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r59-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> Yahner <sup id="cite_ref-r101_25-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r101-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> found the average density of eastern towhees over 6 habitat types was significantly (p&lt;0.05) positively correlated with density of short (2–5 foot (0.5–1.5 m)) shrubs. In east-central Florida slash pine (<i>P. elliottii</i>) flatwoods with understories dominated by myrtle oak (<i>Q. myrtifolia</i>) and sand live oak (<i>Q. geminata</i>) and in scrub sites with scattered slash pine and cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto), eastern towhee densities were significantly (p=0.01) negatively correlated with mean shrub height.<sup id="cite_ref-r14_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r14-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eastern towhees may associate with and avoid certain plants. In riparian vegetation in Iowa, eastern towhee density was significantly (p≤0.01) positively associated with total plant and vine species richness and negatively correlated with forb and deciduous tree species richness.<sup id="cite_ref-r85_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r85-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> In West Virginia, eastern towhees were associated with plant species that occurred on drier ridgetops, such as blackberry (p&lt;0.02), black cherry (p&lt;0.002), and black locust (p&lt;0.04). These sites tended to have open canopies and low tree density.

<b>Nesting habitat</b>: Eastern towhees typically nest on or near the ground. Several literature reviews note the predominance of eastern towhee nests below 5 feet (1.5 m).<sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r34_10-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r34-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r67_12-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r67-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r86_13-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r86-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> In a study of cowbird parasitism on Sanibel Island, all 5 eastern towhee nests located were within 6 feet (2 m) of the ground.<sup id="cite_ref-r74_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r74-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> Nests as high as 18 feet (5.5 m) have been reported in literature reviews.<sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r34_10-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r34-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r67_12-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r67-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Nests higher off the ground in mixed aspen stands of varying ages in Pennsylvania had significantly (p&lt;0.001) lower nest success.

Large snags (≥9&nbsp;inches <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter_at_breast_height" title="Diameter at breast height">diameter at breast height</a> (≥22.9&nbsp;cm)) did not have an effect on nesting success.<sup id="cite_ref-r9_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r9-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Nesting success was not significantly (p&gt;0.05) affected by stand age or distance to edge in even-aged mixed-aspen stands in Pennsylvania.<sup id="cite_ref-r103_18-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r103-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eastern towhees nest in a variety of species including grape and blueberry (<i>Vaccinium</i> spp.). The majority of nests observed in South Carolina loblolly and longleaf pine forests and clearcuts were located in grape, tree sparkleberry (<i>V. arboreum</i>), and oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.).<sup id="cite_ref-r52_14-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r52-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> On an oak-hickory site in West Virginia, 27% of 41 eastern towhee nests were found in grape, 17% in blackberry (<i>Rubus</i> spp.), 12% in greenbrier (<i>Smilax</i> spp.), and 12% in mountain-laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>). Nests also occurred in Virginia creeper (<i>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</i>), spice bush (<i>Lindera benzoin</i>), and azalea (<i>Rhododendron</i> spp.).<sup id="cite_ref-r9_31-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r9-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> In a power line right-of-way in Pennsylvania, the 6 eastern towhee nests observed occurred in Allegheny blackberry, witch-hazel (<i>Hamamelis virginiana</i>), blueberry (<i>Vaccinium</i> spp.), white oak (<i>Q. alba</i>), eastern hayscented fern (<i>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</i>) and sweetfern (<i>Comptonia peregrina</i>) combined, and on ground level. According to literature reviews, eastern towhee nests located on the ground are embedded in litter in dry areas and typically occur at the base of grasses, forbs, low shrubs, or small trees.<sup id="cite_ref-r42_2-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r42-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r67_12-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r67-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
<b>Foraging habitat</b>: Selection of forging habitat by eastern towhees has been investigated in Massachusetts and New Jersey. When gleaning in a southeastern Massachusetts pitch pine barren, eastern towhees preferred species such as pitch pine, bear oak (<i>Q. ilicifolia</i>), and other deciduous trees, mainly oaks. Ericaceous species were avoided. Use differed significantly (p&lt;0.001) from availability.<sup id="cite_ref-r66_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r66-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> On 2 New Jersey sites, eastern towhee foraging preference switched over the course of the breeding season.<sup id="cite_ref-r15_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r15-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> On a site dominated by oaks, primarily black oak (<i>Q. velutina</i>), eastern towhees used oaks in May, as would be expected due to their density. However, in June and July, as relative arthropod biomass declined in oaks, use of oaks was less than would be expected. On a pitch pine-dominated site, use of oaks (primarily bear oak and blackjack oak (<i>Q. marilandica</i>)) was greater than would be expected in May, but was proportionate to availability in June and July. These negative correlations between date and oak use were significant (p&lt;0.025) for both sites. Use of the oak-dominated site also decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) through the summer.<sup id="cite_ref-r15_33-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r15-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup>
<b>Effects of spatial area</b>: Eastern towhees appear to prefer edge habitats in many areas. For instance, the mean abundance of eastern towhees in a baldcypress (<i>Taxodium distichum</i>) in northern Florida was 18, while eastern towhees did not occur in either the baldcypress forest or the clearcut. At the interface of the baldcypress stand and a 13-year-old planted slash pine stand, mean abundance of eastern towhees was 22 breeding birds, while in the planted slash pine stand the average abundance was 15 breeding birds. Density of eastern towhees was found to decline with distance from the edge of a power line right-of-way and an oak-hickory forest in eastern Tennessee. At the edge eastern towhees occurred at a density of just over 10 pairs/40 ha, while 197 feet (60 m) from the edge eastern towhee density had dropped to 1 pair/40 ha.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> In addition, in experimentally clearcut Pennsylvanian forests composed of white oak, northern red oak (<i>Q. rubra</i>), chestnut oak (<i>Q. prinus</i>), scarlet oak (<i>Q. coccinea</i>), red maple, quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen, and pitch pine, male towhees were detected significantly (p&lt;0.05) more often than expected in the areas where the spatial arrangement of clearcuts was most patchy.<sup id="cite_ref-r58_35-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r58-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup>
Several studies have addressed the effect of the size of habitat patches on eastern towhees. In mixed-oak forest in New Jersey, eastern towhee frequency generally increased with patch size, although eastern towhees were detected in all plot sizes (0.5–59 acres (0.2–24 ha)) except 0.02–acre (0.01 ha) plots. On a site in South Carolina, eastern towhee frequency of occurrence increased as clearcut size increased from &lt;2.5 acres (&lt;1 ha) to clearcut sizes from 21 to about 32 acres (8.5–12.8 ha). On another site eastern towhee frequency declined as clearcut size increased from 19 to 33 acres (7.6–13.2 ha) to 48 to 62 acres (19.5–25.2 ha).<sup id="cite_ref-r56_24-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r56-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> Eastern towhees only bred in riparian vegetation patches in Iowa that were at least 650 feet (200 m) wide.<sup id="cite_ref-r85_29-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r85-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> In southern and eastern Pennsylvania eastern towhee nest success was not significantly (p≥0.10) different on sites with gradual edges and those with more distinct edges between "wildlife habitat openings" and oak-hickory forest.<sup id="cite_ref-r26_36-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r26-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eastern towhees primarily eat on the ground, although they also glean from vegetation. In a southeastern Massachusetts pitch pine barren, 73.5% of male and 80.4% of female foraging observations were on the ground.<sup id="cite_ref-r66_32-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r66-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> When foraging on the ground eastern towhees use a scratching technique where both feet kick back simultaneously.<sup id="cite_ref-r86_13-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r86-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> In a laboratory study 4 eastern towhees used this method to successfully obtain seed buried almost 1&nbsp;inch (2.25&nbsp;cm) deep. When foraging above ground the majority of time is spent gleaning foliage.<sup id="cite_ref-r66_32-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r66-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> In Massachusetts, 22.5% of male and 16.3% of female foraging observations were of food being gleaned from foliage. Eastern towhees were also observed gleaning from twigs, branches, and trunks. When gleaning, eastern towhees occurred significantly (p&lt;0.01) more often on the distal half of tree branches compared to using distal and proximal portions equally. In 0.5% of male and 0.3% of female foraging observations, eastern towhees hovered. Eastern towhees were never observed catching food out of the air.<sup id="cite_ref-r66_32-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r66-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eastern towhees eat a variety of plant and animal matter.
