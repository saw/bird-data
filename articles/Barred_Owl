<i>Syrnium varium</i>
The <b>Barred Owl</b> (<i>Strix varia</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typical_owl" title="Typical owl" class="mw-redirect">typical owl</a> native to North America. It goes by many other names, including <b>Eight Hooter</b>, <b>Rain Owl</b>, <b>Wood Owl</b>, and <b>Striped Owl</b>, but is probably best known as the <b>Hoot Owl</b> based on its call.
The adult is 40–63 cm (16–25 in) long with a 96–125 cm (38–49 in) wingspan. Weight in this species is 500 to 1050&nbsp;grams (1.1-2.3&nbsp;lbs).<sup id="cite_ref-owlpages.com_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-owlpages.com-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It has a pale face with dark rings around the eyes, a yellow beak and brown eyes. It is the only typical owl of the eastern United States which has brown eyes; all others have yellow eyes. The head is round and lacks ear tufts, a distinction from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-eared_Owl" title="Short-eared Owl">Short-eared Owl</a>. The upper parts are mottled gray-brown. The underparts are light with markings; the chest is barred horizontally while the belly is streaked vertically. The legs and feet are covered in feathers up to the talons.<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Breeding habitats are dense woods across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, the eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, and south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>;<sup id="cite_ref-iucn_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iucn-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> in recent years it has spread to the northwestern United States, having gradually spread further south in the west. The species is particularly numerous in a variety of wooded habitats in the southeastern United States. Recent studies show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb" title="Suburb">suburban neighborhoods</a> can be ideal habitat for barred owls. Using transmitters, scientists found that populations increased faster in the suburban settings than in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_growth_forest" title="Old growth forest" class="mw-redirect">old growth forest</a>. A factor of this suburban success may be easily accessible rodent prey in such settings. However, for breeding and roosting needs, this species needs at least some large trees and can be locally absent in some urban areas for this reason. The main danger to owls in suburban settings is from cars. The increased offspring offset the death rate due to impacts from cars and disease.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Barred Owls may be partly responsible for the recent decline of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Spotted_Owl" title="Northern Spotted Owl">Northern Spotted Owl</a>, native to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(U.S._state)" title="Washington (U.S. state)" class="mw-redirect">Washington</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon" title="Oregon">Oregon</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>. Since the 1960s, Barred Owls have been expanding their range westward from the eastern US, perhaps because man-made changes have created new suitable habitat in the west.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> When Spotted Owls and Barred Owls share the same environment, the latter are generally more aggressive and out-compete the former, leading to decreased populations of the native owls.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> They have also been known to interbreed, with the hybrids named "Sparred Owl" or "Botted Owl".<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from June 2010">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The Barred Owl's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> is often in a tree cavity, often ones created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileated_woodpecker" title="Pileated woodpecker" class="mw-redirect">pileated woodpeckers</a>; it may also take over an old nesting site made previously by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-shouldered_hawk" title="Red-shouldered hawk" class="mw-redirect">red-shouldered hawk</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper%27s_hawk" title="Cooper's hawk" class="mw-redirect">cooper's hawk</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow" title="Crow">crow</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel" title="Squirrel">squirrel</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> It is a permanent resident, but may wander after the nesting season. If a nest site has proved suitable in the past they will often reuse it as the birds are non-migratory. In the United States, eggs are laid from early-January in southern Florida to mid-April in northern Maine, and consist of 2 to 4 eggs per clutch. Eggs are brooded by the female with hatching taking place approximately 4 weeks later. Young owls <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> four to five weeks after hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> These owls have few predators, but young, unwary owls may be taken by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" title="Cat">cats</a>.

The Barred Owl is a very opportunistic predator. The principal prey of this owl are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadow_vole" title="Meadow vole" class="mw-redirect">meadow voles</a>, followed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse" title="Mouse">mice</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrew" title="Shrew">shrews</a> of various species.

Barred Owls have been known to be attracted to campfires and lights where they forage for large insects. Prey is usually devoured on the spot. Larger prey is carried to a feeding perch and torn apart before eating.
The Barred Owl <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation" title="Predation">hunts</a> by waiting on a high perch at night, or flying through the woods and swooping down on prey. A Barred Owl can sometimes be seen hunting before dark. This typically occurs during the nesting season or on dark and cloudy days. Of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> owls, only the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrowing_Owl" title="Burrowing Owl">Burrowing Owl</a> is more likely to be active during the day. Daytime activity is often most prevalent when Barred Owls are raising chicks.<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-USFWS_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-USFWS-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> However, this species still generally hunts near dawn or dusk.
The usual call is a series of eight accented hoots ending in <i>oo-aw</i>, with a downward pitch at the end. The most common mnemonic device for remembering the call is "Who cooks for you, who cooks for you all." It is noisy in most seasons. When agitated, this species will make a buzzy, rasping hiss. While calls are most common at night, the birds do call during the day as well.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
