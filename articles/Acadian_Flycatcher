The <b>Acadian Flycatcher</b> (<i>Empidonax virescens</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insect</a>-eating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher" title="Tyrant flycatcher">tyrant flycatcher</a> family.

They also have a call similar to that of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Flicker" title="Northern Flicker">Northern Flicker</a>.
The 15 species of this genus were once all thought to be a single species, which was discovered in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadia" title="Acadia">Acadia</a> in present-day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>. Differences in range, voice, and habitat eventually identified them as separate species. The present-day "Acadian Flycatcher" is not found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadia" title="Acadia">Acadia</a>.
Its breeding habitat is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> forests, often near water, across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_United_States" title="Eastern United States">eastern</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>. These birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> through eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> to southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> and the very northwest of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>.
The numbers of these birds have declined somewhat in the southern parts of their range. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-headed_Cowbird" title="Brown-headed Cowbird">Brown-headed Cowbirds</a> lay <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> in the nests of these birds in some areas. However only 16% of cowbird young in Acadian Flycatcher nests fledge successfully.
They wait on a perch in the middle of a tree and fly out to catch insects in flight (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_(birds)" title="Hawking (birds)">hawking</a>), also sometimes picking insects from foliage while hovering (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleaning_(birds)" title="Gleaning (birds)">gleaning</a>). They may eat some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry" title="Berry">berries</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a>.
They make a loose cup nest in a horizontal fork in a tree or shrub.
The Acadian Flycatcher is an excellent flier; it is extremely maneuverable, can hover, and can even fly backward. Curiously, there is no scientific information on hopping or walking by this bird.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
