The <b>Canyon Wren</b> (<i>Catherpes mexicanus</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> songbird of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wren" title="Wren">wren</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family" title="Family">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troglodytidae" title="Troglodytidae" class="mw-redirect">Troglodytidae</a>. It is resident throughout its range and is generally found in arid, rocky cliffs, outcrops and canyons. It is a small bird that is hard to see on its rocky habitat; however, it can be heard throughout the canyons by its distinctive loud and beautiful song. It is currently in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic_taxon" title="Monotypic taxon">monotypic taxon</a> and is the only species in the genus <i>Catherpes</i>.
The taxonomy of the species has been altered and debated for many years with between three and eleven subspecies being proposed at various times. Generally, three subspecies are recognized. Originally in the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thryothorus" title="Thryothorus" class="mw-redirect">Thryothorus</a></i>, it was moved into the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salpinctes" title="Salpinctes" class="mw-redirect">Salpinctes</a></i> along with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Wren" title="Rock Wren">Rock Wren</a> (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salpinctes_obsoletus" title="Salpinctes obsoletus" class="mw-redirect">Salpinctes obsoletus</a></i>), where some researchers still place it; however, generally now the species is in the only species in the genus <i>Catherpes</i>.
The three generally recognized subspecies are: 1) <i>C. m. mexicanus</i> occurring in the central and southern portions of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Plateau" title="Mexican Plateau">Mexican Plateau</a>; 2) <i>C. m. albifrons</i> occurring in the northern portion of the Mexican Plateau, into west-central through western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>; and 3) <i>C. m. conspersus</i> occurring in the remaining portion of the range in the U.S. and Canada. These subspecies are distinguished by the bill of <i>C. m. albifrons</i> is generally longer than that of <i>C. m. mexicanus</i>, and plumage paler, with upperparts more grayish brown, with narrower black bars on tail. In <i>C. m. conspersus</i> the plumage is paler and it is smaller than <i>C. m. mexicanus</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>

Similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Wren" title="Rock Wren">Rock Wren</a> in habitat, the Canyon Wren prefers steeper rocky environments, particularly in arid landscapes and deep canyons and terrain (sometimes including buildings, woodpiles, and rock fences).
The canyon wren feeds on small insects and spiders. Since they live on large rocks, they use their long beaks to scope out small crevices. They also get their source of liquid from the insects they consume.
It feeds on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a> by probing into crevices with its long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a>. Its coloration is rustier than that of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Wren" title="Rock Wren">Rock Wren</a>, with a contrasting white throat and breast. The Canyon Wren is more often heard than seen, and its falling series of whistles is one of the more familiar bird calls of the canyons of the western United States.
It builds a cup <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> out of twigs and other vegetation in a rock crevice. It lays 4 to 6 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>, white with reddish brown and gray speckles.
