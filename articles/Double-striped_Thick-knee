It also occurs on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispaniola" title="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> and some of the Venezuelan islands, and is a very rare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrancy_(biology)" title="Vagrancy (biology)">vagrant</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura%C3%A7ao" title="Curaçao">Curaçao</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">USA</a>.
This is a largely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_animal" title="Nocturnal animal" class="mw-redirect">nocturnal</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular" title="Crepuscular">crepuscular</a> species of arid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland" title="Grassland">grassland</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savanna</a>, and other dry, open habitats. The nest is a bare scrape into which two olive-brown eggs are laid and incubated by both adults for 25–27 days to hatching. The downy young are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precoces" title="Precoces" class="mw-redirect">precocial</a> and soon leave the nest.
The Double-striped Thick-knee is a medium-large wader with a strong black and yellow bill, large yellow eyes, which give it a reptilian appearance, and cryptic plumage. The scientific <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> name refers to the prominent joints in the long greenish-grey legs, and <i>bistriatus</i> to the two stripes of the head pattern.
The adult is about 46–50&nbsp;cm long and weighs about 780-785 g. It has finely streaked grey-brown upperparts, and a paler brown neck and breast merging into the white belly. The head has a strong white supercilium bordered above by a black stripe. Juveniles are similar to adults, but have slightly darker brown upperparts and a whitish nape.
Double-striped Thick-knee is striking in flight, with a white patch on the dark upperwing, and a white underwing with a black rear edge. However, it avoids flying, relying on crouching and camouflage for concealment. The song, given at night, is a loud <i>kee-kee-kee</i>.
There are four subspecies, differing in size and plumage tone, but individual variation makes identification of races difficult.
The Double-striped Thick-knee eats large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and other small vertebrate and invertebrate prey. It is sometimes semi-domestcated because of its useful function in controlling insects, and has benefited from the clearing of woodlands to create pasture.
