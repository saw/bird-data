<b>Bachman's Sparrow</b> <i>(Peucaea aestivalis)</i>, is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_sparrow" title="American sparrow">American sparrow</a> that is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism" title="Endemism">endemic</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States" title="Southeastern United States">southeastern United States</a>. This species was named in honor of Reverend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bachman" title="John Bachman">John Bachman</a>.
Adults have rufous brown upperparts and crown with grey and black streaking on the nape, back and primaries. The face is gray with a rufous brown eyestripe. It has buff colored breast and whitish belly. These are mid-sized New World sparrows, measuring 12.2–16.2 cm (4.8–6.4 in) and weighing 18.4–23 g (0.65–0.81 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Their breeding habitat is open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine" title="Pine">pine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_coniferous_forest" title="Temperate coniferous forest">forests</a>. The domed nest is usually built on the ground near a clump of grass or a bush. Females lay 3–5 eggs.
Bachman's Sparrow is primarily a non-migratory resident, but it may retreat from some of the most northerly territories. The species is mainly a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_predation" title="Seed predation">granivore</a>, but it will also take some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>.
This bird is considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Threatened" title="Near Threatened">Near Threatened</a>, with habitat loss one of the major factors often cited in its decline. Habitat degradation due to later stages of forest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_succession" title="Ecological succession">succession</a> has also been attributed to the decline of this species. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn" title="Controlled burn">Prescribed forest burns</a> may assist in recovery.
The song begins as a clear whistle, followed by a short trill.
According to literature reviews, Bachman's sparrows occur primarily in the southeastern United States from the central region of peninsular Florida north to limited areas of extreme southern Virginia and west through portions of Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri to eastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas.<sup id="cite_ref-r19_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r19-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r47_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r47-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Bachman's sparrows may rarely occur in more northerly areas that were part of their historic breeding range, including most of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia and parts of Pennsylvania and Maryland.<sup id="cite_ref-r19_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r19-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r45_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r45-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-r62_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r62-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>

Bachman's sparrow nests are constructed on the ground by females and are primarily made of grasses. All nests (n=71) found in a study in shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of Arkansas were built on the ground. Most nests (70%) were built at the base of bluestem clumps, although nests were found at the base of small trees, forbs, and other grass species.<sup id="cite_ref-r30_8-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r30-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> On the same study site, only 7% of nests were not either partially or completely domed.

In shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations in Arkansas, females incubated eggs for 13 to 14 days. The average nestling period was 9 days, and the average period between fledging and independence was 25 days. Both parents care for the young during these periods.<sup id="cite_ref-r30_8-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r30-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Although there is a lack of data, a review suggests that Bachman's sparrows probably breed the year after hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-r19_3-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r19-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Bachman's sparrows exhibit some fidelity to breeding sites. Over a 2 year period in shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of central Arkansas, 6 of 34 adults returned to areas where they had a territory in a previous year. This varied across years, with a 29% return rate of adult birds banded in 1983 and none of the adults banded in 1984 returning to the site in 1985.

There is evidence that Bachman sparrow may prefer sites with some tall vegetation. In north-central Florida, densities of Bachman's sparrows in young (2–4 years) slash pine plantations with artificial snags added (n=3) was 31.4 pairs/km², while in similar vegetation without snags (n=3) Bachman's sparrow density was 22.3 pairs/km² [8]. In an area in South Carolina composed of longleaf and loblolly pine, Bachman's sparrow occurred at significantly (p=0.002) higher density in clearcuts than middle-aged (22–50 years) stands, while in another area clearcuts had relatively low densities of Bachman's sparrows. Vegetation differences between the 2 sites are likely to explain the difference. The site with relatively low densities of Bachman's sparrows had been drumchopped, which resulted in a lower volume of vegetation from 3 to 7 feet (1–2 m) above ground. The authors suggest that the lack of vegetation in this height range may have limited perches, resulting in fewer birds on the site.<sup id="cite_ref-r18_13-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r18-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> An investigation of Bachman's sparrow habitat characteristics in 1- to 6-year-old loblolly pine stands of eastern Texas led to recommendations that 2 to 5 tall (&gt;39 feet (12 m)) trees/100 ha remain on a clearcut for Bachman sparrow singing perches.<sup id="cite_ref-r70_18-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r70-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> In Georgia, the lack of vegetation from 10 to &lt;16 feet (3 to &lt;5 m) was suggested as a possible reason for the absence of Bachman's sparrows from open field vegetation.<sup id="cite_ref-r28_19-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r28-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> However, across the southeast, vegetation density from 3 to 6 feet (0.91–1.8 m) above ground varies widely on sites occupied by Bachman's sparrows, suggesting their requirements for the density of this vegetation layer are comparatively flexible.<sup id="cite_ref-r33_16-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r33-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
In the dry prairie of central Florida, Bachman's sparrows used clumps of saw-palmetto that had "natural" burrows significantly (p&lt;0.001) more than would be expected based on availability. The authors suggest that Bachman's sparrows in prairie habitat use burrows as areas of refuge from predators.<sup id="cite_ref-r14_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r14-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup>
Several studies have investigated the importance of landscape attributes on Bachman's sparrows. For a discussion of the possible importance of patchiness of vegetation within a site see the habitat characteristics section.
The ability of the Bachman's sparrow to detect and colonize areas before they are no longer suitable may depend on the size and isolation of the habitat. In south-central Missouri, only glades ≥ 29 acres (11.7 ha) were occupied by Bachman's sparrows.<sup id="cite_ref-r10_11-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r10-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> The probability of Bachman's sparrow occupying pine-grassland restoration stands in Mississippi increased as size of areas with long burning rotations, short-harvest rotations, and no removal of hardwoods decreased (p=0.05) and as the perimeter to area ratio of these areas increased (p=0.02).<sup id="cite_ref-r73_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r73-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> In South Carolina, distance from source populations significantly (p≤ 0.05) influenced the ability of Bachman's sparrows to colonize recent clearcuts in both years on one study area and in 1 of 2 years in another study area. The authors suggest that the presence of corridors in the latter study area may have resulted in distance being less influential.<sup id="cite_ref-r16_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r16-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>
Bachman's sparrows' association with edge habitat is uncertain. In eastern Texas clearcuts with relatively abundant loblolly pine, sites with Bachman's sparrow territories were significantly (p&lt;0.01) closer to the edge of the study area and the number of Bachman's sparrows was significantly (p&lt;0.05) correlated (r=–0.22) with distance to edge.<sup id="cite_ref-r5_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r5-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> However, in dry prairie of central Florida the difference in Bachman's sparrow densities in edge and core habitat was not significant (p≥0.36), and both edge and core habitat were considered population sinks.<sup id="cite_ref-r50_10-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r50-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Territory size of Bachman's sparrows varies. In Missouri glades, reports of average Bachman's sparrow breeding territory range from 1.5 acres (0.62 ha, n=13) to 7 acres (2.9 ha, n=7).<sup id="cite_ref-r10_11-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r10-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> In loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations of central Arkansas, mean home range size (n=25) during the breeding season was 6 acres (2.5 ha).<sup id="cite_ref-r32_14-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r32-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> In on a south-central Florida site with saw palmetto and scrub palmetto (Sabal etonia) interspersed amongst threeawn (<i>Aristida</i> spp.), Bachman's sparrow territories (n=6) averaged 12.5 acres (5.1 ha). In winter (November–January), the average home range size of 8 Bachman's sparrows was 1.6 acres (0.65 ha) in the dry prairie of central Florida.<sup id="cite_ref-r14_22-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r14-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup>
Bachman's sparrow density during in the breeding season has been estimated in several habitats. On clearcuts of various ages with relatively abundant loblolly pine in eastern Texas, maximum Bachman sparrow density was 1.9/10 ha.<sup id="cite_ref-r5_21-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r5-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> In South Carolina, Bachman's sparrow densities ranged from 0 to 0.48/ha across sites of different ages and management regimes.<sup id="cite_ref-r18_13-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r18-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> In Georgia, Bachman sparrow densities ranged from 0 to 0.92 birds/ha on sites ranging from an open field to middle-aged and mature forests composed primarily of loblolly pine.<sup id="cite_ref-r28_19-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r28-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> In a south-central Florida community composed of saw palmetto, scrub palmetto, and threeawn, Bachman's sparrow density averaged 1 male/33 ha. In dry prairie of central Florida, Bachman's sparrow densities varied from 0.92 to 3.24 territories/10 ha across sites and years.<sup id="cite_ref-r50_10-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r50-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Bachman's sparrow densities calculated from breeding bird censuses in longleaf pine forests was &gt;15 territories/40 ha, while densities from winter bird population studies were from 6 to 10 individuals/40 ha.<sup id="cite_ref-r21_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r21-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup>
Bachman's sparrows forage on the ground for plant seeds and arthropods. In a predominately loblolly and shortleaf pine habitat of eastern Texas, all Bachman's sparrow foraging observations were on the ground<sup id="cite_ref-r1_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r1-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> and a literature review states that Bachman's sparrows rarely forage in shrubs.<sup id="cite_ref-r19_3-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r19-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
