The <b>Common Poorwill</b> (<i>Phalaenoptilus nuttallii</i>) is a nocturnal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> of the family Caprimulgidae, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightjar" title="Nightjar">nightjars</a>. It is found from British Columbia and southeastern Alberta, through the western United States to northern Mexico. The bird's habitat is dry, open areas with grasses or shrubs, and even stony desert slopes with very little vegetation.
Many northern birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to winter within the breeding range in central and western Mexico, though some remain further north. Remarkably, the Common Poorwill is the only bird known to go into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpor" title="Torpor">torpor</a> for extended periods (weeks to months).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> This happens on the southern edge of its range in the United States, where it spends much of the winter inactive, concealed in piles of rocks. This behavior has been reported in California and New Mexico. Such an extended period of torpor is close to a state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernation" title="Hibernation">hibernation</a>, not known among other birds. It was described definitively by Dr. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Jaeger" title="Edmund Jaeger">Edmund Jaeger</a> in 1948 based on a Poorwill he discovered hibernating in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuckwalla_Mountains" title="Chuckwalla Mountains">Chuckwalla Mountains</a> of California in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1946_in_science" title="1946 in science">1946</a>.
Jaeger's observations may have been influenced by earlier observations of torpor in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-throated_Swift" title="White-throated Swift">White-throated Swift</a> made by his acquaintance Wilson Hanna, a resident of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside,_California" title="Riverside, California">Riverside, California</a> area and noted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oology" title="Oology">oologist</a>.
In 1804, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meriwether_Lewis" title="Meriwether Lewis">Meriwether Lewis</a> observed hibernating Common Poorwills in North Dakota during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition" title="Lewis and Clark Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>. Though these observations were recorded carefully in Lewis's journal, their significance was not understood. This was at least in part because the Common Poorwill was not then recognized as a species distinct from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip-poor-will" title="Whip-poor-will" class="mw-redirect">Whip-poor-will</a> of eastern North America.
Native Americans of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi" title="Hopi" class="mw-redirect">Hopi</a> tribe were likely aware of the Poorwill's behavior even earlier—the Hopi word for the bird means "The Sleeping One".<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
This is the smallest North American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightjar" title="Nightjar">nightjar</a>, about 18&nbsp;cm (seven inches) in length, with a wingspan of approximately 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;inches). It weighs 36–58 g. The sexes are similar, both gray and black patterned above. The outer tail-feathers are tipped with white, the markings slightly more prominent in the male.
The Common Poorwill is told from similar nightjars by its small size, short bill, rounded wings with tips that reach the end of the short tail at rest, and pale gray coloration. Like many other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightjar" title="Nightjar">nightjars</a>, the common name derives from its call, a monotonous <i>poor-will</i> given from dusk to dawn. At close range a third syllable of the call may be heard, resulting in a <i>poor-will-low</i>. It also gives a <i>chuck</i> note in flight.
Up to five subspecies are described, although these are all quite similar, and some may be of dubious validity.
Like other members of this family it feeds on nocturnal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth" title="Moth">moths</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle" title="Beetle">beetles</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper" title="Grasshopper">grasshoppers</a>. It ejects pellets of the indigestible parts, in the manner of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owl</a>. The Common Poorwill frequently takes prey off of the ground or by leaping into the air from the ground. It is reported to drink on the wing.
The nest of the Common Poorwill is a shallow scrape on the ground, often at the base of a hill and frequently shaded partly by a bush or clump of grass. The clutch size is typically two, and the eggs are white to creamy, or pale pink, sometimes with darker mottling. Both sexes incubate for 20–21 days to hatching, with another 20–23 days to fledging. There is usually one brood per year, but females may sometimes lay and incubate a second clutch within 100 m of the first nest while the male feeds young at the first site. The young are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial" title="Precocial">semiprecocial</a>. An adult disturbed on the nest tumbles and opens its mouth, hissing, apparently imitating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake" title="Snake">snake</a>.
Breeding is from March to August in the south of the range, and late May to September further north.
The genus name <i>Phalaenoptilus</i> is a compound of Greek <i>phalaina</i>, moth and <i>ptilon</i>, feather. The species name <i>nuttallii</i> honors English-born American ornithologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Nuttall" title="Thomas Nuttall">Thomas Nuttall</a>.
