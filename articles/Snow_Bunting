<i>Passerina nivalis</i>
The <b>Snow Bunting</b> (<i>Plectrophenax nivalis</i>), sometimes colloquially called a <b>snowflake</b>, is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longspur" title="Longspur">longspur</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcariidae" title="Calcariidae">Calcariidae</a>. It is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">arctic</a> specialist, with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle" title="Arctic Circle">circumpolar</a> Arctic breeding range throughout the northern hemisphere. There are small isolated populations on a few high mountain tops south of the Arctic region, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairngorms" title="Cairngorms">Cairngorms</a> in central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Elias_Mountains" title="Saint Elias Mountains">Saint Elias Mountains</a> on the southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon" title="Yukon">Yukon</a> border, and also Cape Breton Highlands.<sup id="cite_ref-byers_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-byers-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
It is fairly large and long-winged for a bunting, 15–18&nbsp;cm long and with a wingspan of 32–38&nbsp;cm, and weighing 26–50&nbsp;g. In flight, it is easily identified by its large white wing patches. The breeding male is unmistakable, with all white plumage and a black back; the breeding female is grey-black where the male is solid black. In winter plumage, both sexes are mottled pale ginger, blackish and white above, and pale ginger and white below, with the males having more white than the females. The bill is yellow with a black tip, all black in summer males. Unlike most passerines, it has feathered tarsi, an adaptation to its harsh environment. No other passerine can winter as far north as this species apart from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Raven" title="Common Raven">Common Raven</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-byers_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-byers-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-bwpc_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bwpc-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The call is a distinctive rippling whistle, "per,r,r,rit" and the typical <i>Plectrophenax</i> warble "hudidi feet feet feew hudidi".
It builds its bulky nest in rock crevices. The eggs are blue-green, spotted brown, and hatch in 12–13 days, and the young are already ready to fly after a further 12–14 days.<sup id="cite_ref-bwpc_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bwpc-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>

The species is not endangered at present, with good populations.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> It shows little fear of humans, and often nests around buildings in Arctic areas, readily feeding on grain or other scraps put out for it.<sup id="cite_ref-byers_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-byers-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The breeding habitat is on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a>, treeless moors, and bare mountains. It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering a short distance further south in open habitats in northern temperate areas, typically on either sandy coasts, steppes, prairies, or low mountains, more rarely on farmland stubble. In winter, it forms mobile flocks.<sup id="cite_ref-byers_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-byers-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_ice_age" title="Last ice age" class="mw-redirect">last ice age</a>, the Snow Bunting was widespread throughout continental <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
