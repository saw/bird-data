Distributed across most of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics" title="Tropics">tropical</a> and warmer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate" title="Temperate" class="mw-redirect">temperate</a> regions of the world, in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> it is rather localized. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> it is more widely distributed, and it is ubiquitous across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt" title="Sun Belt">Sun Belt</a> of the United States and in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest" title="Tropical rainforest">rainforests</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>. It is sometimes confused with the <b>Great White Heron</b> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, which is a white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)" title="Polymorphism (biology)">morph</a> of the closely related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blue_Heron" title="Great Blue Heron">Great Blue Heron</a> (<i>A. herodias</i>). Note, however, that the name Great White Heron has occasionally been used to refer to the Great Egret.
The Great Egret is a large heron with all-white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a>. Standing up to 1&nbsp;m (3.3&nbsp;ft) tall, this species can measure 80 to 104 cm (31 to 41 in) in length and have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingspan" title="Wingspan">wingspan</a> of 131 to 170 cm (52 to 67 in).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Body mass can range from 700 to 1,500 g (1.5 to 3.3 lb), with an average of around 1,000&nbsp;g (2.2&nbsp;lb).<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> It is thus only slightly smaller than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blue_Heron" title="Great Blue Heron">Great Blue</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Heron" title="Grey Heron">Grey Heron</a> (<i>A. cinerea</i>). Apart from size, the Great Egret can be distinguished from other white egrets by its yellow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> and black legs and feet, though the bill may become darker and the lower legs lighter in the breeding season. In breeding plumage, delicate ornamental feathers are borne on the back. Males and females are identical in appearance; juveniles look like non-breeding adults. Differentiated from the Intermediate Egret (<i>Mesophoyx intermedius</i>) by the gape, which extends well beyond the back of the eye in case of the Great Egret, but ends just behind the eye in case of the Intermediate Egret. It is a common species, usually easily seen.
It has a slow flight, with its neck retracted. This is characteristic of herons and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittern" title="Bittern">bitterns</a>, and distinguishes them from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stork" title="Stork">storks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(bird)" title="Crane (bird)">cranes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibis" title="Ibis">ibises</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonbill" title="Spoonbill">spoonbills</a>, which extend their necks in flight.
The Great Egret is not normally a vocal bird; at breeding colonies, however, it often gives a loud croaking <i>cuk cuk cuk</i>.
Like all egrets, it is a member of the heron <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardeidae" title="Ardeidae" class="mw-redirect">Ardeidae</a>. Traditionally classified with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stork" title="Stork">storks</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciconiiformes" title="Ciconiiformes">Ciconiiformes</a>, the Ardeidae are closer relatives of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican" title="Pelican">pelicans</a> and belong in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelecaniformes" title="Pelecaniformes">Pelecaniformes</a> instead. The Great Egret—unlike the typical egrets—does not belong to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egretta" title="Egretta">Egretta</a></i> but together with the great herons is today placed in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardea_(genus)" title="Ardea (genus)">Ardea</a></i>. In the past, however, it was sometimes placed in <i>Egretta</i> or separated in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotype_(biology)" title="Monotype (biology)" class="mw-redirect">monotypic</a> genus <i><b>Casmerodius</b></i>.
There are four <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> in various parts of the world, which differ but little. Differences are bare part coloration in the breeding season and size; the largest <i>A. a. modesta</i> from Asia and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia" title="Australasia">Australasia</a> some taxonomists consider a full species, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Great_Egret" title="Eastern Great Egret">Eastern Great Egret</a> (<i>Ardea modesta</i>).:
The Great Egret is partially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_hemisphere" title="Northern hemisphere" class="mw-redirect">northern hemisphere</a> birds moving south from areas with colder winters. It breeds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_colony" title="Bird colony">colonies</a> in trees close to large lakes with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_bed" title="Reed bed">reed beds</a> or other extensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland" title="Wetland">wetlands</a>. It builds a bulky stick nest.
The Great Egret is generally a very successful species with a large and expanding range. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, large numbers of Great Egrets were killed around the end of the 19th century so that their plumes could be used to decorate hats. Numbers have since recovered as a result of conservation measures. Its range has expanded as far north as southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>. However, in some parts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States" title="Southern United States">southern United States</a>, its numbers have declined due to habitat loss. Nevertheless, it adapts well to human habitation and can be readily seen near wetlands and bodies of water in urban and suburban areas. In 1953 the Great Egret in flight was chosen as the symbol of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audubon_Society" title="National Audubon Society">National Audubon Society</a>, which was formed in part to prevent the killing of birds for their feathers.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Great Egret is one of the species to which the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_on_the_Conservation_of_African-Eurasian_Migratory_Waterbirds" title="Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds">Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</a> (AEWA) applies.
On 22 May 2012, it was announced a pair of Great Egrets were nesting in the UK for the first time at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapwick_Heath" title="Shapwick Heath">Shapwick Heath</a> nature reserve in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset" title="Somerset">Somerset</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Aviss_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Aviss-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The species is a rare visitor to the UK and Ben Aviss of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> stated that the news could mean the UK's first Great Egret colony is established.<sup id="cite_ref-Aviss_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Aviss-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> The following week, Kevin Anderson of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_England" title="Natural England">Natural England</a> confirmed a Great Egret chick had hatched, making it a new breeding bird record for the UK.<sup id="cite_ref-Hallett_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hallett-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Anderson commented "We've definitely seen one chick stretching a wing just before the adult arrived and also after it left and we continue to monitor for more. The eggs of the Great White Egret can hatch over a period of a few days so it may be that if there are other young on the nest they will be less developed and won't be visible yet."<sup id="cite_ref-Hallett_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hallett-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Great Egret feeds in shallow water or drier habitats, feeding mainly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a>, small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, and occasionally small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile" title="Reptile">reptiles</a> and insects, spearing them with its long, sharp bill most of the time by standing still and allowing the prey to come within its striking distance of its bill which it uses as a spear. It will often wait motionless for prey, or slowly stalk its victim.
