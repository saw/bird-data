The <b>Spectacled Owl</b>, <i>Pulsatrix perspicillata,</i> is a large tropical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owl</a>. It is a resident breeder from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, south to southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> and northwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> There are six subspecies.<sup id="cite_ref-ITIS_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ITIS-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Spectacled Owl is found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> (Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama), Trinidad and Tobago, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> (Colombia; Venezuela, Suriname, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina).<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Spectacled Owl is can range from 43 to 52 cm (17 to 20 in) in length. Mass in males can range from 453 to 700 g (1.00 to 1.5 lb), whereas females can weigh from 680 to 1,000 g (1.5 to 2.2 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-Burnie_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Burnie-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> It is unmistakable with brown upperparts, head and upper breast, white facial markings and whitish to yellowish-ochre underparts. The eyes are yellow and the beak is pale. The juvenile is even more distinctive than the adult, being completely white apart from a chocolate brown facial disc. Of the six subspecies, only the nominate and <i>P. p. saturata</i> are well described. <i>P. p. saturata</i> differs from the typical Spectacled Owl only in that it is black on the head and the back, with black barring on the sides.<sup id="cite_ref-Konig_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Konig-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The primary sound made by the Spectacled Owl consists of knocking or tapping sounds with a popping effect: <i>PUP-pup-pup-pup-po</i> or <i>BOO Boo boo boo boo</i>. Each progressive note becomes weaker but faster as the call continues. Females also make a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawk</a>-like scream, <i>ker-WHEEER</i>, which has often been compared to a steam-whistle.
The Spectacled Owl is primarily a bird of tropical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_forest" title="Rain forest" class="mw-redirect">rain forests</a>, being found mostly in areas where dense, old-growth forest is profuse. However, it may enter secondary habitats, such as forest edges, especially while hunting. On occasion, they have been found in dry forests, treed savanna plains, plantations and semi-open areas with trees.
This species is largely nocturnal, starting activity right around the time of last light at dusk and usually being back on their roosts for the day around first light. It is a solitary, unsocial bird, usually roosting singly each day and only peaceable associating with others of their own species for reproductive purposes.
The Spectacled Owl is typical the largest and most dominant owl in its range, with the larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Horned_Owl" title="Great Horned Owl">Great Horned Owl</a> rarely venturing into true rainforest habitats. Most hunting starts with the owl perched on a branch and scanning the area, then dropping with a quick pounce when prey is located. It preys principally on a wide array of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, eating almost anything type that is nocturnally active. Various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent" title="Rodent">rodents</a> may be primary but other mammals preyed on have included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposum" title="Opposum" class="mw-redirect">opposums</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk" title="Skunk">skunks</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Konig_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Konig-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Prey species can be heavier than the predating owl, weigh over 1.5&nbsp;kg (3.3&nbsp;lb) as in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didelphis" title="Didelphis">Didelphis</a></i> opossums, and even the much larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-toed_sloth" title="Three-toed sloth">three-toed sloth</a> has been reported to have been killed.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">Invertebrates</a> are eaten regularly as well, mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar" title="Caterpillar">caterpillars</a>, but also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab" title="Crab">crabs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail" title="Snail">snails</a>, large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Konig_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Konig-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Insects may be gleaned directly from foliage while the large owls actively forage. Birds are also taken, including species, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay" title="Jay">jays</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon" title="Pigeon" class="mw-redirect">pigeons</a>, which are taken off of their nocturnal perches and smaller types of owl.<sup id="cite_ref-Konig_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Konig-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
In Costa Rica, eggs are laid variously in the dry season (November–May), or at the start of the wet season (June–July). This owl typically nests in an unlined tree cavity. Spectacled Owls lay 1-2 eggs, which are incubated by the female for about 5 weeks. Chicks leave the nest for surrounding branches at about 5–6 weeks, well before they can fly, but depend on their parents for up to a year once fledged. Often, only one of the chicks will survive.
