The <b>Tamaulipas Crow</b> (<i>Corvus imparatus</i>) a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow" title="Crow">crow</a> found in northeastern Mexico and some of southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>.
It is a relatively small and sleek looking crow, 34–38 centimetres (13–15 in) in length. It has very glossy dark, bluish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a>, which appears soft and silky. The bill is quite slender and black, as are the legs and feet. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahuan_Raven" title="Chihuahuan Raven">Chihuahuan Raven</a>, a much larger and very different bird, is the only crow it commonly occurs alongside.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinaloan_Crow" title="Sinaloan Crow" class="mw-redirect">Sinaloan Crow</a> (<i>Corvus sinaloae</i>) appears to be genetically extremely close to this bird and can be considered the western form of it though the voice is quite different, indeed a third species, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_Crow" title="Fish Crow">Fish Crow</a> (<i>Corvus ossifragus</i>) of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States" title="Southeastern United States">southeastern United States</a> appears to be very closely related to them also and the three may be considered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superspecies" title="Superspecies">superspecies</a>.
Occurring in a relatively small area in northeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, it inhabits near desert scrub and bushland and includes farms, small towns and villages in its range. It also occurs in more humid woodland in open areas but does not appear to be found in the higher mountains or along the seashore. It is a sociable bird often forming large flocks, moving together in close groups. Its northern range reaches <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Texas" title="Brownsville, Texas">Brownsville</a> in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> where it has been known to nest.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Food would appear to be mainly insects taken on the ground though eggs and nestlings are taken in trees as well as many fruits and berries.
The nest is similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Crow" title="American Crow">American Crow</a> but smaller and is built in a tree or large bush.
The voice of this crow is unusual and unlike most other species of the genus <i>Corvus</i>. It has a low croaking sound rather like a frog and a call that is described as a soft <i>"gar-lik"</i>.
