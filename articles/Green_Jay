The <b>Green Jay</b> (<i>Cyanocorax yncas</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> species of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay" title="Jay">jays</a>, which exhibits distinct regional variations within its large but discontinuous range. This stretches from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> south into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, with a break before the species reappears in a broad sweep across the highlands (primarily the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a>) of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>. It has been suggested that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxa" title="Taxa" class="mw-redirect">taxa</a> should be considered separate species, <i>Cyanocorax luxuosus</i>. If following this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy" title="Taxonomy">taxonomy</a>, the northern species retains the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_name" title="Common name">common name</a> Green Jay, while the South American population, which retains the scientific name <i>C. yncas</i>, is renamed the <b>Inca Jay</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Green Jays of the Northern population are smaller, at 25â€“29&nbsp;cm (10-11.5&nbsp;in), than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South American</a> birds, at 29.5-34.3&nbsp;cm (11.7-13.6&nbsp;in). Weight ranges from 66 to 110&nbsp;grams (2.3-3.9&nbsp;oz).<sup id="cite_ref-allaboutbirds_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-allaboutbirds-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> They have feathers of yellowish-white with blue tips on the top of the head, cheeks and nape, though some taxa have more blue than others. In South American populations, the crown can appear almost entirely white, with less extensive blue, and there's a prominent black crest behind the bill. A black bib forms a thick band up to the sides of the head as well as a stripe through the eye line and one above it. The breast and underparts typically are bright to dull yellow, or strongly green-tinged in the far northernmost part of its range. The upper parts are rich green. It has large nasal bristles that form a distinct tuft in some subspecies, but are less developed in others. The color of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" title="Iris (anatomy)">iris</a> ranges from dark brownish to bright yellow depending on the subspecies.
Green Jays feed on a wide range of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> and various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal" title="Cereal">cereal</a> grains. They take ebony (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebenopsis" title="Ebenopsis">Ebenopsis</a></i> spp.) seeds where these occur, and also any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak" title="Oak">oak</a> species' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn" title="Acorn">acorns</a>, which they will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(biology)" title="Cache (biology)" class="mw-redirect">cache</a>. Meat and human scraps add to the diet when opportunity arises. Green Jays have been observed using sticks as tools to extract <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> from tree <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark" title="Bark">bark</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Green Jays usually build a nest in a tree or in a thorny bush or thicket, and the female lays three to five <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>. Only the female incubates, but both parents take care of the young. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, the Green Jay is recorded as retaining offspring for several years, and those young help the parents raise more chicks.<sup id="cite_ref-allaboutbirds_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-allaboutbirds-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
As with most of the typical jays, this species has a very extensive voice repertoire. The bird's most common call makes a <i>rassh-rassh-rassh</i> sound, but many other unusual notes also occur. One of the most distinctive calls sounds like an alarm bell.
Their basic diet consists of arthropods, vertebrates, seeds, and fruit.
