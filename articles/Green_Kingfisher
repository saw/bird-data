This small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingfisher" title="Kingfisher">kingfisher</a> breeds by streams in forests or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove" title="Mangrove">mangroves</a>. The nest is in a horizontal tunnel up to a metre long made in a river bank. The female lays three, sometimes four, eggs.
The Green Kingfisher is 19 centimetres (7.5&nbsp;in) long and weighs 27 grams (0.95&nbsp;oz). It has the typical kingfisher shape, with a short tail and long bill. It is oily green above, with white markings on the wings and tail, and a white collar around the neck.
Males have white underparts apart from a broad chestnut breast band and some green spotting on the flanks. Females have buff-white underparts with two green chest bands, the lower of which links to the green spotting along the sides of the belly.
Green Kingfishers are often seen perched on a low shaded branch close to water before plunging in head first after their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> prey. They also eat aquatic insects. These birds often give a pebbly rattling call.
