The <b>Least Auklet</b> (<i>Aethia pusilla</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> and the smallest species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auk" title="Auk">auk</a>. It is the most abundant seabird in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, and one of the most abundant in the world, with a population of around nine million birds. They breed on the islands of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>, and spend the winter close to the edge of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheet" title="Ice sheet">ice sheet</a><sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs clarification or removal of jargon from May 2012">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup>. Their largest colonies are on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleutian_Islands" title="Aleutian Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Lawrence_Island" title="St. Lawrence Island">St. Lawrence Island</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Diomede_Island" title="Little Diomede Island">Little Diomede Island</a>.
Least Auklets feed predominantly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calanoida" title="Calanoida">calanoid</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copepod" title="Copepod">copepods</a>, particularly those of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Neocalanus&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Neocalanus (page does not exist)">Neocalanus</a></i>. They also eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphausiid" title="Euphausiid" class="mw-redirect">euphausiids</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteropod" title="Pteropod" class="mw-redirect">pteropods</a> and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooplankton" title="Zooplankton">zooplankton</a> species. They hunt for these in stratified waters caused where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwelling" title="Upwelling">upwelling</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocline" title="Thermocline">thermoclines</a> cause these prey items to be tightly clumped together. Like all auks they are pursuit divers, using their wings to provide thrust and "fly" under the water. They are voracious predators, consuming 86% of their body weight each day.
Least Auklets are highly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird_colony" title="Seabird colony" class="mw-redirect">colonial</a>, nesting in rocky crevices in colonies of up to a million birds. These colonies are often mixed, with other species of auklet nesting with, and competing with the Least Auklets. While this coexistence with other species may bring the benefits of protection from predators, Least Auklets are vulnerable to being displaced from their nesting sites by the larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crested_Auklet" title="Crested Auklet">Crested Auklets</a>. A single egg is laid in the crevice and incubated for a month, after which a semi-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial" title="Precocial">precocial</a> black downy chick is hatched. Both parents share incubation duties, as well as brooding and feeding duties. Unlike many auks, which are fed fish carried crosswise in the bill, chicks of the Least Auklet are fed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copepod" title="Copepod">copepods</a> and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooplankton" title="Zooplankton">zooplankton</a> from a sublingual pouch, as are other small auklets. The chicks receive no further parental care after they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a>, and can dive to hunt as soon as they leave the nest.
Least Auklets are vulnerable to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_spill" title="Oil spill">oil spills</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species" title="Introduced species">introduced species</a>. The introduction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Fox" title="Arctic Fox" class="mw-redirect">Arctic Foxes</a> to many of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleutian_Islands" title="Aleutian Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> caused the species to be wiped out on many of those islands, and rats are also a problem on many islands. However, at present they are still a very common species.
