<b>Sprague's Pipit</b> <i>(Anthus spragueii)</i> is a small songbird (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a>) in the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motacillidae" title="Motacillidae">Motacillidae</a> that breeds in the short- and mixed-grass prairies of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. Migratory, it spends the winters in the southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Sprague's Pipits are unique among songbirds in that they sing high in the sky, it is more often identified by its distinctive descending song heard from above then it is seen on the ground. Males and females are cryptically coloured and similar in appearance; they are a buffy brown with darker streaking, slender bills and pinkish to yellow legs. Sprague's Pipit summer habitat is primarily native grasslands in the north central prairies of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>.

Sprague’s Pipits were listed in 1999 by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cosewic.gc.ca/">[1]</a> as “Threatened”; the status was re-examined and confirmed in May 2000. Sprague’s Pipits were officially listed under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_at_Risk_Act" title="Species at Risk Act">Species at Risk Act</a> (SARA) as “Threatened” on 5 June 2003 (Jones 2010). In the United States, Sprague’s Pipits are a Candidate for listing as “Endangered” or “Threatened” under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973" title="Endangered Species Act of 1973" class="mw-redirect">Endangered Species Act of 1973</a>; however, listing Sprague’s Pipits is precluded by higher listing priorities <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
They breed in habitat with minimal human disturbance, such as grazing, haying or other human development. Sprague's Pipit is a ground nesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> and standing dead vegetation is used to build the canopy over the nest.
Breeding begins as early as late April and continues until mid to late August. Nests are a small cup of grass found on the ground with standing dead vegetation folded over to create a canopy. There is a single entrance to the nest. Four to six eggs are typically laid within the nests with an average incubation time of 13–14 days.
Renesting and second broods have been occasionally documented for Sprague’s Pipit, as has polygyny; however, they are predominantly single-brooded (Jones et al. 2010).
Sprague's Pipit's eat various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insects" title="Insects" class="mw-redirect">insects</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiders" title="Spiders" class="mw-redirect">spiders</a>, and sometimes seeds. During the breeding season the adults are almost entirely insectivorous and feed the young on insects as well.
