<b>Cooper's Hawk</b> (<i>Accipiter cooperii</i>)often confused with the Sharp-Shinned Hawk, is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawk</a> native to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> continent and found from Southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> to Northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. As in many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_prey" title="Birds of prey" class="mw-redirect">birds of prey</a>, the male is smaller than the female. The birds found east of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> tend to be larger on average than the birds found to the west.
Cooper's Hawk was first described by French naturalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lucien_Bonaparte" title="Charles Lucien Bonaparte">Charles Lucien Bonaparte</a> in 1828. It is a member of the goshawk genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter" title="Accipiter">Accipiter</a></i>. This bird was named after the naturalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cooper_(conchologist)" title="William Cooper (conchologist)">William Cooper</a>, one of the founders of the New York Lyceum of Natural History (later the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Academy_of_Sciences" title="New York Academy of Sciences">New York Academy of Sciences</a>) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>.

The average size of an adult male ranges from 220 to 410 g (7.8 to 14 oz) with a length between 35 and 46 cm (14 and 18 in). The adult male is significantly smaller than the average female, which weigh 330 to 700 g (12 to 25 oz) and measure 42 to 50 cm (17 to 20 in) long. Its wingspan ranges from 62 to 94 cm (24 to 37 in).<sup id="cite_ref-allaboutbirds1_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-allaboutbirds1-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Individuals living in the eastern regions, where the sexes average 349&nbsp;g (12.3&nbsp;oz) and 566&nbsp;g (20.0&nbsp;oz), tend to be larger and heavier than those in the western regions, where the respective sexes average 280&nbsp;g (9.9&nbsp;oz) and 440&nbsp;g (16&nbsp;oz).<sup id="cite_ref-umich2000_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich2000-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Cooper's Hawks have short rounded wings, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> measuring 21.4–27.8 cm (8.4–10.9 in) long, and a relatively long tail, 17–20.5 cm (6.7–8.1 in) long, with dark bands, round-ended at the tip.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> As in most <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter" title="Accipiter">Accipiters</a></i>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is relatively long, measuring 5.6–7.6 cm (2.2–3.0 in) long, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is relatively small, with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmen_(bird)" title="Culmen (bird)" class="mw-redirect">culmen from the cere</a> measuring only 1.5–2.1 cm (0.59–0.83 in).<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Adults have red eyes and have a black cap, with blue-gray upper parts and white underparts with fine, thin, reddish bars.

Although the coloration is generally somewhat similar between Sharp-shinned Hawks and Cooper's Hawks, Cooper's appear broader-chested and larger headed, with generally more robust features. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow" title="Crow">crow</a>-like size of Cooper's Hawks is sometimes distinctive from the Sharp-shin but this can be less reliable in large female Sharp-shins. Goshawks are usually more distinctive in their larger size and differing plumage markings, with the juvenile Goshawk having broader, darker streaking below with more irregular patterns than the immature Cooper's. The Cooper's Hawk appears long-necked in flight and has been described by birdwatchers as looking like a "flying cross". The Cooper’s Hawk is seen mostly flying with quick, consecutive wing beats and a short glide, though they may also soar.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
Their breeding range extends from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.

These birds capture <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey" title="Prey" class="mw-redirect">prey</a> from cover or while flying quickly through dense vegetation, relying almost totally on surprise. One study showed that this is a quite dangerous hunting style.

The Cooper’s Hawks are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a>, but most do not mate for life. Pairs will breed once a year and raise one brood per breeding season. Courtship displays include stylized flights with the wings positioned in a deep arc. During their flight displays the male will begin by diving toward the female. A slow speed-chase follows involving the male flying around the female exposing his expanded under tail coverts to her. The male raises his wings high above the back and flies in a wide arc with slow, rhythmic flapping. Courting usually occurs on bright, sunny days, in midmorning.<sup id="cite_ref-umich2000_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich2000-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> After pairing has occurred, the males make a bowing display before beginning to build the nest.<sup id="cite_ref-allaboutbirds1_3-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-allaboutbirds1-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Their breeding habitats are forested areas. The breeding pair builds a stick nest in large trees. Over a two week period the pair builds the nest. The nests are piles of sticks around 27&nbsp;inches in diameter and 6- 17&nbsp;inches high with a cup- shaped depression in the middle that is 8&nbsp;inches across and 4&nbsp;inches deep. Their nests are built in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine" title="Pine">pines</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak" title="Oak">oaks</a>, Douglas- firs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeches" title="Beeches" class="mw-redirect">beeches</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruces" title="Spruces" class="mw-redirect">spruces</a>, and other tree species usually on flat ground rather than on a hillside. The nests typically are about 25–50 feet high off the ground, halfway up the tree, and out on a horizontal branch.<sup id="cite_ref-allaboutbirds1_3-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-allaboutbirds1-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch" title="Clutch">clutch</a> size is usually 3 to 5 eggs. The cobalt-blue eggs average about 48 x 38&nbsp;mm (1.9 x 1.5&nbsp;in) and weigh about 43&nbsp;g (1.5&nbsp;oz). The female incubates the eggs between 30 to 36&nbsp;days.<sup id="cite_ref-umich2000_5-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich2000-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchling" title="Hatchling">hatchlings</a> are about 28&nbsp;g (1&nbsp;oz) and 9&nbsp;cm (3.8&nbsp;in) long and are completely covered in white down.<sup id="cite_ref-allaboutbirds1_3-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-allaboutbirds1-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> They are brooded for about two weeks by the female, while her mate forages for food. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledging" title="Fledging" class="mw-redirect">fledging</a> stage is reached at 25 to 34&nbsp;days of age, though the offspring will return to the nest to be fed until they become independent around 8 weeks. Eggs and nestlings are preyed on, rarely, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon" title="Raccoon">raccoons</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow" title="Crow">crows</a> as well as other competing Cooper's Hawks. Adults rarely fall prey to larger raptors, namely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Hawk" title="Red-tailed Hawk">Red-tailed Hawks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Horned_Owl" title="Great Horned Owl">Great Horned Owls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_Falcon" title="Peregrine Falcon">Peregrine Falcons</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Eagle" title="Golden Eagle">Golden Eagles</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Goshawk" title="Northern Goshawk">Northern Goshawks</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-umich2000_5-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich2000-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Cooper’s Hawks communicate using vocalizations and displays. Vocal is probably preferred over display, because the denseness of their habitat could prevent displays from being seen from a distance. Males are usually submissive to females and will listen for reassuring call notes the females make when they are willing to be approached.<sup id="cite_ref-allaboutbirds2_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-allaboutbirds2-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> The males have a higher pitched voice than females.<sup id="cite_ref-umich2000_5-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich2000-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Cooper’s Hawks have been known to live as long as 12 years in the wild. However, the oldest known living hawk was 20 years and 4 months old.<sup id="cite_ref-umich2000_5-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich2000-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
At one time, Cooper's Hawks were heavily hunted in persecution for preying on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry" title="Poultry">poultry</a> and were called "chicken hawks". It is now known that predation by these hawks on domestic animals borders on negligible, and they are rarely hunted these days. Cooper's Hawks' breeding success was also reduced by the use of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticide</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">DDT</a>, but the ban of DDT ended that threat.<sup id="cite_ref-allaboutbirds2_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-allaboutbirds2-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Since then, the adaptable Cooper's Hawk has thrived. However, one threat facing Cooper’s Hawks today is the degradation and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_loss" title="Habitat loss" class="mw-redirect">loss of habitat</a>. Management activities like logging may make their former habitat unsuitable for breeding.<sup id="cite_ref-umich2000_5-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-umich2000-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The Cooper's Hawk, as a natural predator of almost any North American bird smaller than itself, can inadvertently deplete populations of rarer, conservation-dependent species. The American Kestrel, whose populations have experienced considerable decrease, is one species in which the extensive predation by the recovered Cooper's hawk population is a major concern.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
