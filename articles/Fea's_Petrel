<i>Pterodroma mollis feae</i>
<b>Fea's Petrel</b> (<i>Pterodroma feae</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadfly_petrel" title="Gadfly petrel">gadfly petrel</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a>, <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterodroma" title="Pterodroma" class="mw-redirect">Pterodroma</a></i>. It was previously considered to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft-plumaged_Petrel" title="Soft-plumaged Petrel">Soft-plumaged Petrel</a>, <i>P. mollis</i>, but they are actually not closely related at all. However, <i>P. feae</i> is very closely related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zino%27s_Petrel" title="Zino's Petrel">Zino's Petrel</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertas_Petrel" title="Desertas Petrel">Desertas Petrel</a>, two other species recently split from <i>P. mollis</i>.
The gadfly petrels in the genus <i>Pterodroma</i> are seabirds of temperate and tropical oceans. Many are little-known and poorly studied, and their often similar appearance has meant that the taxonomy of the group has been rather fluid.<sup id="cite_ref-Onley_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Onley-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The forms breeding in Macaronesia on Madeira, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugio_Island" title="Bugio Island">Bugio</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertas_Islands" title="Desertas Islands">Desertas Islands</a>, and in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde" title="Cape Verde">Cape Verde</a> archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the southern hemisphere Soft-plumaged Petrel <i>P. mollis</i>, but differences in size, vocalisations, breeding behaviour and mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that the northern birds are not closely related to <i>P. mollis</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-sangster_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sangster-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Petrel" title="Bermuda Petrel">Bermuda Petrel</a> or Cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds.<sup id="cite_ref-Onley_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Onley-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Sangster recommended establishing Zino's Petrel on Madeira and Fea's Petrel on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species,<sup id="cite_ref-sangster_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sangster-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and the species split was accepted by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_European_Rarities_Committees" title="Association of European Rarities Committees">Association of European Rarities Committees</a> (AERC) in 2003.<sup id="cite_ref-aerc_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-aerc-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> More recently, some authorities have further split Fea's Petrel, separating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertas_Islands" title="Desertas Islands">Desertas Islands</a> breeding birds from those in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde" title="Cape Verde">Cape Verde</a> archipelago.<sup id="cite_ref-shirihai_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shirihai-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Sangster estimated that the two Macaronesian species they diverged at the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Pleistocene" title="Early Pleistocene">Early Pleistocene</a>, 850,000 years ago,<sup id="cite_ref-sangster_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sangster-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> although the methodology used to establish this time scale has subsequently been questioned.<sup id="cite_ref-Rheindt_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rheindt-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> An analysis of feather lice from Fea's Petrel's <i>Pterodroma feae deserti</i> from Bugio Island and Zino's Petrels from the Madeiran mainland showed that there were marked differences between the two seabirds in terms of the parasites they carried, suggesting that they have long been isolated, since lice can normally only be transferred through physical contact in the nest. The species on Zino's Petrel are most similar to those of the Bermuda Petrel, whereas Fea's Petrel's lice are like those of Caribbean and Pacific <i>Pterodromas</i>. This suggests that despite the close physical proximity of the two species of gadfly petrel found in the Madeiran archipelago, they may have arisen from separate colonisations of mainland Madeira and, later, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertas_Islands" title="Desertas Islands">Desertas Islands</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Zonfrillo_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Zonfrillo-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>

This long-winged petrel is 33–36&nbsp;cm in length with an 86–94&nbsp;cm wingspan. It has a grey back and wings, with a dark "W" marking across the wings. The undersides of the wings are dark and the belly is white. It has a fast impetuous flight. It picks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton" title="Plankton">planktonic</a> food items from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">ocean</a> surface. This species is very similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zino%27s_Petrel" title="Zino's Petrel">Zino's Petrel</a>, but is larger and has a thicker black bill.
As all three of species in the <i>Pterodroma feae/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterodroma_madeira" title="Pterodroma madeira" class="mw-redirect">madeira</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterodroma_desertae" title="Pterodroma desertae" class="mw-redirect">desertae</a></i> complex were once believed to be subspecies of a single species: <i>Pterodroma mollis</i>. Well-understood is the extreme difficulty in telling them apart. A summary of data from a morphological study sheds light on the issue:<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
In terms of ratios:
It breeds in the north <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde_Islands" title="Cape Verde Islands" class="mw-redirect">Cape Verde Islands</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeira_Islands" title="Madeira Islands" class="mw-redirect">Madeira Islands</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugio_Island" title="Bugio Island">Bugio Island</a>).
It is a rare visitor to waters off the eastern US, though known only from sight records and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographs" title="Photographs" class="mw-redirect">photographs</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> has not accepted these records, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Birding_Association" title="American Birding Association">American Birding Association</a> has accepted them only as "Fea's/Zino's Petrel".
It is also an extremely rare vagrant to western Europe, principally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, though most records there are also acceptable only as "Fea's/ Zino's", with the exception of three at-sea records in British waters.
