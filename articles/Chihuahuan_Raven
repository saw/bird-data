The <b>Chihuahuan Raven</b> (<i>Corvus cryptoleucus</i>), is a species of bird in the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvidae" title="Corvidae">Corvidae</a> that is native to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. It was formerly known as the American White-necked Raven, and has the proportions of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Raven" title="Common Raven">Common Raven</a> with a heavy bill, but is about the same size as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion_Crow" title="Carrion Crow">Carrion Crow</a>, or slightly larger than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Crow" title="American Crow">American Crow</a> (44–51 cm (17–20 in) long). The plumage is all-black with a rich purple-blue gloss in good light. The nasal bristles extend farther down the top of the bill than in any other <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvus_(genus)" title="Corvus (genus)" class="mw-redirect">Corvus</a></i> species to about two-thirds the length. The base of the neck feathers are white (seen only when ruffled in strong wind). The bill, legs and feet are black.
The Chihuahuan Raven occurs in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">Southwestern</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States" title="Midwestern United States">Midwestern</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, including southeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>, southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>, southeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>, western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>, western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma" title="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, and southern and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
It feeds on cultivated cereal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain" title="Grain" class="mw-redirect">grains</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and many other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a>, small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile" title="Reptile">reptiles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion" title="Carrion">carrion</a> and scraps of human food, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus" title="Cactus">cactus</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a>, eggs and nestlings.
The nest is built in either trees, large shrubs or sometimes even in old buildings. There are usually 5-7 eggs laid relatively late in the year during May so as to take advantage of the insect food for their young in their more arid environment.
The voice is similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Raven" title="Common Raven">Common Raven</a> with <i>"pruk-pruk"</i> sounds and other croaks but is not as deep in tone or as varied in range.
A 2005 molecular study reviewed segments of DNA of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Raven" title="Common Raven">Common Raven</a> and found that Chihuahuan Raven are genetically nested within Common Ravens based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA" title="Mitochondrial DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a>. That is, Common Ravens from the California <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade" title="Clade">Clade</a> are more similar in mtDNA to Chihuahuan Ravens than they are to Common Ravens in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holarctic" title="Holarctic">Holarctic</a> Clade.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> (also see Omland et al. 2000—Omland, K.
