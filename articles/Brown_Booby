Brown Boobies are spectacular divers, plunging into the ocean at high speed. They mainly eat small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid" title="Squid">squid</a> which gather in groups near the surface and may catch leaping fish while skimming the surface. Although they are powerful and agile fliers, they are particularly clumsy in takeoffs and landings; they use strong winds and high perches to assist their takeoffs.
