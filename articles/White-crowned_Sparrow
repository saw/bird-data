These birds forage on the ground or in low vegetation, but sometimes make short flights to catch flying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>. They mainly eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a>, other plant parts and insects. In winter, they often forage in flocks.
White-crowned Sparrows nest either low in bushes or on the ground under shrubs and lay 3â€“5 brown-marked grey or greenish-blue eggs.
The White-crowned Sparrow is known for its natural alertness mechanism, which allows it to stay awake for up to two weeks during migration.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> This effect has been studied for possible human applications, such as shift-work drowsiness or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_driver" title="Truck driver">truck driving</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
