<i>Rupornis magnirostris</i>
The <b>Roadside Hawk</b> (<i>Buteo magnirostris</i>) is a relatively small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">bird of prey</a> found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a>. This vocal species is often the most common raptor in its range. It has many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> and is sometimes placed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic" title="Monotypic" class="mw-redirect">monotypic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i>Rupornis</i> instead of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteo" title="Buteo">Buteo</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Roadside Hawk is 31–41 centimetres (12–16 in) long and weighs 250–300 grams (8.8–11 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Males are about 20% smaller than females, but otherwise the sexes are similar.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> In most subspecies, the lower breast and underparts are barred brown and white, and the tail has four or five grey bars. Twelve subspecies are usually recognised and there is significant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> variation between these. Depending on the subspecies involved, the Roadside Hawk is mainly brown or grey. It is fairly common to observe a touch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufous" title="Rufous">rufous</a> (i.e., a light reddish-brownish coloration) on the bird's wings, specially when it is in flight.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Its call is a very high-pitched piercing squeak. The eyes of adult Roadside Hawks are whitish or yellow. As suggested by its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_name_(zoology)" title="Specific name (zoology)">specific name</a> (<i>magni</i> = large; <i>rostri</i> = beak), its beak is relatively large.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Roadside Hawk may be marginally the smallest hawk in the widespread genus <i>Buteo</i>, although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridgway%27s_Hawk" title="Ridgway's Hawk">Ridgway's Hawk</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-rumped_Hawk" title="White-rumped Hawk">White-rumped Hawk</a> are scarcely larger.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> In flight, the relatively long tail and disproportionately short wings of the Roadside Hawk are distinctive. It frequently soars, but does not hover.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Roadside Hawk is common throughout its range: from Mexico through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> to most of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> east of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a> cordillera. It is found from the northern Caribbean coast of South America south to the northeastern parts of Argentina. With the possible exception of dense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest" title="Rainforest">rainforests</a>, the Roadside Hawk is well adapted to most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystems" title="Ecosystems" class="mw-redirect">ecosystems</a> in its range. It is also an urban bird, and is possibly the most common species of hawk seen in various cities throughout its range – or perhaps just the most conspicuous one, as it becomes aggressive when nesting and has been recorded attacking humans passing near the nest.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Roadside Hawk's diet consists mainly of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamate" title="Squamate" class="mw-redirect">squamates</a>, and small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, such as young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Marmoset" title="Common Marmoset" class="mw-redirect">Common Marmosets</a> and similar small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey" title="Monkey">monkeys</a> which are hunted quite often.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> It will also take small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds" title="Birds" class="mw-redirect">birds</a>, but far less often than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalist_and_specialist_species" title="Generalist and specialist species">generalists</a> such as the related but larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-tailed_Hawk" title="White-tailed Hawk">White-tailed Hawk</a>, or bird specialists like the more distantly related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplomado_Falcon" title="Aplomado Falcon">Aplomado Falcon</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-species_feeding_flock" title="Mixed-species feeding flock" class="mw-redirect">Mixed-species feeding flocks</a> it encounters when hunting in open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerrado" title="Cerrado">cerrado</a> habitat are not particularly wary of it: they watch it lest the hawk come too close, but consider them hardly more of a threat than the diminutive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Kestrel" title="American Kestrel">American Kestrel</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
