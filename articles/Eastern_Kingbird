The <b>Eastern Kingbird</b> (<i>Tyrannus tyrannus</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher" title="Tyrant flycatcher">tyrant flycatcher</a> native to North America.
Adults are grey-black on the upperparts with light underparts; they have a long black tail with a white end and long pointed wings. They have a red patch on their crown, seldom seen. They are of average size for a kingbird, at 19–23&nbsp;cm (7.5–9&nbsp;in), 33–38&nbsp;cm (13–15&nbsp;in) across the wings and weighing 33-55 g (1.2-1.9&nbsp;oz).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The call is a high-pitched, buzzing and unmusical chirp, frequently compared to an electric fence.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Their breeding habitat is open areas across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. They make a sturdy cup nest in a tree or shrub, sometimes on top of a stump or pole. These <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aves" title="Aves" class="mw-redirect">birds</a> aggressively defend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)" title="Territory (animal)">their territory</a>, even against much larger birds.<sup id="cite_ref-cornell_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cornell-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
These birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> in flocks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>. There is one European record, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> in October 2012.
They wait on an open perch and fly out to catch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> in flight, sometimes hovering to pick food off vegetation. They also eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry" title="Berry">berries</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a>, mainly in their wintering areas.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Some eastern kingbirds place their nests in the open while others hide nests very well. Eastern kingbirds in Southern British Columbia can nest in open fields; in shrubs over open water; high in tall trees and even in the tops of small stumps. Both male and female participate in nest defense, but females may stay on well-hidden nests longer than females with open nests who may leave nests earlier to chase away predators. Those pairs nesting in the open may be able to see predators coming earlier and rely on aggressive behavior to protect their young.
The aggressive behavior of eastern kingbirds has been shown to keep ravens and crows from finding experimental nests placed near kingbird nests. Similar experimental nests placed far from the kingbird nests were found far more often by crows and ravens. They can also recognize and remove <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-headed_Cowbird" title="Brown-headed Cowbird">cowbird</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> from their nests.
