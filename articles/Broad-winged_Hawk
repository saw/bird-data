Broad-winged Hawks' wings are relatively short and broad with a tapered, somewhat pointed appearance. There are two types of colouration: a dark morph with fewer white areas and a light morph that is more pale overall. Although the Broad-winged Hawk's numbers are relatively stable, populations are declining in some parts of its breeding range because of forest fragmentation.

Broad-winged Hawks are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivores" title="Carnivores" class="mw-redirect">carnivores</a>. The types of food they eat depends on the time of year. During the summer or nesting season the parents and ultimately their chicks will eat small mammals, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipmunks" title="Chipmunks" class="mw-redirect">chipmunks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrews" title="Shrews" class="mw-redirect">shrews</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voles" title="Voles" class="mw-redirect">voles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogs" title="Frogs" class="mw-redirect">frogs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizards" title="Lizards" class="mw-redirect">lizards</a>, and sometimes even other nesting birds.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> In the winter months Broad-winged Hawks have been observed feeding on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insects" title="Insects" class="mw-redirect">insects</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogs" title="Frogs" class="mw-redirect">frogs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes" title="Snakes" class="mw-redirect">snakes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab" title="Crab">crabs</a>, and some small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammals" title="Mammals" class="mw-redirect">mammals</a>. To catch their prey Broad-winged Hawks will watch from low branches hiding in the foliage until a target is spotted. From their roost they will do a short fast glide to capture the prey. They give special attention to preparing their food for consumption, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinning" title="Skinning">skinning</a> frogs and snakes and plucking prey birds' feathers. Most small mammals on the other hand will be eaten whole.

These birds will have only one mate during the breeding season, possibly because the male also helps a small amount with the rearing of the chicks.<sup id="cite_ref-Matray1974_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Matray1974-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> They will breed between April and August starting when they reach sexual maturity at about two years old.<sup id="cite_ref-Matray1974_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Matray1974-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
To attract and court females, the males will perform a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship_display" title="Courtship display">courtship display</a> flight including cartwheels, dives, and other aerial acrobatics. Birds meet in the air, hook their feet together and spiral down together.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> They will also compete and fight with other males for the chance to mate with a female. If one of the males is successful, the mating pair will have only one brood that season consisting of one to four eggs.<sup id="cite_ref-Matray1974_15-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Matray1974-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
Both the male and female will build the nest out of sticks and twigs in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> tree before the eggs are to be laid. Once they are though, the brown-spotted eggs are usually 49 by 39 millimetres (1.9&nbsp;in ×&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;in) and weigh about 42 grams (1.5&nbsp;oz). The female will then develop a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_patch" title="Brood patch">brood patch</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubate</a> the eggs for 28&nbsp;days or longer before they hatch.
The hatchlings will appear semi-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" title="Altricial">altricial</a>; incapable of any complex coordination but have open eyes and are covered in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_feathers" title="Down feathers" class="mw-redirect">down feathers</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Lyons1987_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lyons1987-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> Chicks will have rapid body growth until they are almost at adult body size at which time they are capable of walking, flying and eating without parental help.<sup id="cite_ref-Lyons1987_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lyons1987-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> While in the nest the female gives most of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_care" title="Parental care" class="mw-redirect">parental care</a>, protecting and taking care of the chicks. It is not unusual to have the male provide some food for the female and offspring but his visits are short lived.
Once a prey item is obtained for the nest, the female will tear off pieces and will feed the chicks until they are able to rip meat off on their own. Often the chicks will fight for possession of the offered morsel, the younger ones usually losing and not getting enough.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>
Broad-winged Hawks will protect their nests in a show of aggression (i.e. diving and chasing) towards any suspected threat but they generally will not make physical contact.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Predators of eggs and nestlings include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon" title="Raccoon">raccoons</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crows" title="Crows" class="mw-redirect">crows</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupines" title="Porcupines" class="mw-redirect">porcupines</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Black_Bear" title="American Black Bear" class="mw-redirect">American Black Bears</a>.
