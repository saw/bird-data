Their breeding habitat is the northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> islands in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and coastal areas in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> and northwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. They nest on the ground either elevated on rocks or in lower damp location. The males makes several scrapes; the female choose one and lays 3 or 4 eggs. The male takes the major responsibility for incubation and tends the chicks. The young feed themselves.
In Britain, these birds occur in winter in good numbers principally along the east and south coasts, where they favour rocky shorelines adjacent to the sea. It is much rarer as a breeding bird, found only in a localised area of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairngorms_National_Park" title="Cairngorms National Park">Cairngorms National Park</a>, where 1-3 pairs have bred since the 1970s. Records of breeding by this species in the UK are monitored and archived by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Breeding_Birds_Panel" title="Rare Breeding Birds Panel">Rare Breeding Birds Panel</a>.
They are late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrants</a> and move to rocky ice-free <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> coasts in winter. most go no further south than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>. They are fairly gregarious, forming small flocks, often with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnstone" title="Turnstone">Ruddy Turnstones</a>. This species is tame and approachable.
These birds forage on rocky coasts, picking up food by sight. They mainly eat arthropods and mollusks, also some plant material.
The Purple Sandpiper is one of the species to which the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_on_the_Conservation_of_African-Eurasian_Migratory_Waterbirds" title="Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds">Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</a></i> (AEWA) applies.
