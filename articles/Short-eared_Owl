<i>Asio accipitrinus</i>
The <b>Short-eared Owl</b> (<i>Asio flammeus</i>) is a species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typical_owl" title="Typical owl" class="mw-redirect">typical owl</a> (family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strigidae" title="Strigidae" class="mw-redirect">Strigidae</a>). In Scotland this species of owl is often referred to as a cataface, grass owl or short-horned hootlet. Owls belonging to genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asio" title="Asio">Asio</a></i> are known as the eared owls, as they have tufts of feathers resembling mammalian ears. These "ear" tufts may or may not be visible. <i>Asio flammeus</i> will display its tufts when in a defensive pose. However, its very short tufts are usually not visible. The Short-eared Owl is found in open country and grasslands. The word <i>flammeus</i> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> for "flaming, or the color of fire".<sup id="cite_ref-op_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-op-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
<i>Asio flammeus</i>, the Short-eared Owl, is a medium-sized owl measuring 34–43 cm (13–17 in) in length and weighing 206–475 g (7.3–16.8 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> It has large eyes, big head, short neck, and broad wings. Its bill is short, strong, hooked and black. Its plumage is mottled tawny to brown with a barred tail and wings. The upper breast is significantly streaked (Alsop 2001). Its flight is characteristically floppy due to its irregular wingbeats. The Short-eared Owl may also be described as "moth or bat-like" in flight.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Wingspans range from 85 to 110 cm (33 to 43 in).<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Females are slightly larger than males. The yellow-orange eyes of <i>A. flammeus</i> are exaggerated by black rings encircling each eye, giving the appearance of them wearing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascara" title="Mascara">Mascara</a>, and large, whitish disks of plumage surrounding the eyes like a mask.
Over much of its range, Short-eared Owls occurs with the similar-looking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-eared_Owl" title="Long-eared Owl">Long-eared Owl</a>. At rest, the ear-tufts of Long-eared Owl serve to easily distinguish the two (although Long-eared Owl can sometimes hold its ear-tufts flat). The iris-colour differs: yellow in Short-eared, and orange in Long-eared, and the black surrounding the eyes is vertical on Long-eared, and horizontal on Short-eared. Overall Short-eared tends to be a paler, sandier bird than Long-eared. There are a number of other ways in which the two species the the differ which are best seen when they are flying: a) Short-eared often has a broad white band along the rear edge of the wing, which is not shown by Long-eared; b) on the upperwing, Short-eared Owl's primary-patches are usually paler and more obvious; c) the band on the upper side of Short-eared Owl's tail are usually bolder than those of Long-eared; d) Short-eared's innermost secondaries are often dark-marked, contrasting with the rest of the underwing; e) Long-eared Owl has streaking throughout its underparts whereas on Short-eared the streaking ends at the breast; f) the dark markings on the underside of the tips of the longest primaries are bolder on Short-eared Owl; g) the upperparts are coarsely blotched, whereas on Long-eared they are more finely marked. Short-eared Owl also differs structurally from Long-eared, having longer, slimmer wings: Long-eared Owl has wings shaped more like those of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawny_Owl" title="Tawny Owl">Tawny Owl</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The Long-eared Owl generally has different habitat preferences from the Short-eared, most often being found concealed in areas with dense wooded thickets. The Short-eared Owl is often most regularly seen flying about in early morning or late day as it hunts over open habitats.
Currently, there are ten recognized subspecies of the Short-eared Owl:<sup id="cite_ref-ITIS_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ITIS-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Short-eared Owl occurs on all continents except <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>; thus it has one of the largest distributions of any bird. <i>A. flammeus</i> breeds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands" title="Galápagos Islands">Galápagos Islands</a>. It is partially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, moving south in winter from the northern parts of its range. The Short-eared Owl is known to relocate to areas of higher rodent populations (Ehrlich 1988). It will also wander nomadically in search of better food supplies during years when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vole" title="Vole">vole</a> populations are low. See a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Short-eared_Owl.html#fig1">map of the Short-eared Owl's distribution</a> across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a>.
Sexual maturity is attained at one year. Breeding season in the northern hemisphere lasts from March to June, peaking in April. During this time these owls may gather in flocks. During breeding season, the males make great spectacles of themselves in flight to attract females. The male swoops down over the nest flapping its wings in a courtship display (Ehrlich 1988). These owls are generally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a>.
The Short-eared Owl nests on the ground in prairie, tundra, savanna, or meadow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_(ecology)" title="Habitat (ecology)" class="mw-redirect">habitats</a>. Nests are concealed by low vegetation, and may be lightly lined by weeds, grass, or feathers (Ehrlich 1988). Approximately 4 to 7 white eggs are found in a typical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)" title="Clutch (eggs)">clutch</a>, but clutch size can reach up to a dozen eggs in years when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vole" title="Vole">voles</a> are abundant. There is one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring" title="Offspring">brood</a> per year. The eggs are incubated mostly by the female for 21–37 days. Offspring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> at a little over four weeks. This owl is known to lure predators away from its nest by appearing to have a crippled wing (Alsop 2001).
Hunting occurs mostly at night, but this owl is known to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_animal" title="Diurnal animal" class="mw-redirect">diurnal</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular" title="Crepuscular">crepuscular</a> as well. Its daylight hunting seems to coincide with the high-activity periods of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vole" title="Vole">voles</a>, its preferred prey.<sup id="cite_ref-daylight_hunting_explanation_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-daylight_hunting_explanation-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> It tends to fly only feet above the ground in open fields and grasslands until swooping down upon its prey feet-first (Alsop 2001). Several owls may hunt over the same open area (Kaufman 2000). Its food consists mainly of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodents" title="Rodents" class="mw-redirect">rodents</a>, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vole" title="Vole">voles</a>, but it will eat other small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse" title="Mouse">mice</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_squirrel" title="Ground squirrel">ground squirrels</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrew" title="Shrew">shrews</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat" title="Bat">bats</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskrat" title="Muskrat">muskrats</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(animal)" title="Mole (animal)">moles</a>. It will also occasionally predate smaller birds, especially when near sea-coasts and adjacent wetlands at which time they attack <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorebird" title="Shorebird" class="mw-redirect">shorebirds</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">terns</a> and small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gulls</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabirds</a> with semi-regularity. Avian prey is more infrequently preyed on inland and centers on passerines such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lark" title="Lark">larks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icterid" title="Icterid">icterids</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling" title="Starling">starlings</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher" title="Tyrant flycatcher">tyrant flycatchers</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipit" title="Pipit">pipits</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">Insects</a> supplement the diet and Short-eared Owls may prey on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach" title="Cockroach">roaches</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper" title="Grasshopper">grasshoppers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle" title="Beetle">beetles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katydid" title="Katydid" class="mw-redirect">katydids</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar" title="Caterpillar">caterpillars</a>. Competition can be fierce in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Harrier" title="Northern Harrier" class="mw-redirect">Northern Harrier</a>, with which the owl shares similar habitat and prey preferences. Both species will readily harass the other when prey is caught.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
Short-eared Owls have a scratchy bark-like call. Raspy <i>waowk, waowk, waowk</i> or <i>toot-toot-toot-toot-toot</i> sounds are common. A loud <i>eeee-yerp</i> is also heard on breeding grounds. However, Short-eared Owls are silent on the wintering grounds (Alsop 2001).
It is listed as declining in the southern portion of its range. It is listed as of special concern, threatened, or endangered in some states and common in northern portion of breeding range.<sup id="cite_ref-All_About_Birds_-_cornell.edu_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-All_About_Birds_-_cornell.edu-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
