The <b>Forster's Tern</b> (<i>Sterna forsteri</i>) is a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">tern</a> family Sternidae. It breeds inland in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">winters</a> south to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>.
This species is rare but annual in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and has wintered in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> on a number of occasions. No European tern winters so far north.
This species breeds in colonies in marshes. It nests in a ground scrape and lays three or more eggs. Like all white terns, it is fiercely defensive of its nest and young.
The Forster's Tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, but will also hawk for insects in its breeding marshes. It usually feeds from saline environments in winter, like most <i>Sterna</i> terns. It usually dives directly, and not from the "stepped-hover" favoured by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Tern" title="Arctic Tern">Arctic Tern</a>. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.
This is a small tern, 33–36&nbsp;cm long with a 64–70&nbsp;cm wingspan. It is most similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Tern" title="Common Tern">Common Tern</a>. It has pale grey upperparts and white underparts. Its legs are red and its bill is red, tipped with black. In winter, the forehead becomes white and a characteristic black eyemask remains. Juvenile Forster's Terns are similar to the winter adult. The call is a harsh noise like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-headed_Gull" title="Black-headed Gull">Black-headed Gull</a>.
This species is unlikely to be confused with the Common Tern in winter because of the black eyemask, but is much more similar in breeding plumage. Forster's has a grey centre to its white tail, and the upperwings are pure white, without the darker primary wedge of Common.
This bird is named after the naturalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Reinhold_Forster" title="Johann Reinhold Forster">Johann Reinhold Forster</a>.
