<i>Sterna elegans</i> <small>Gambel, 1849</small>
The <b>Elegant Tern</b> (<i>Thalasseus elegans</i>, syn. <i>Sterna elegans</i> - see Bridge <i>et al.</i>, 2005) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">tern</a> family Sternidae. It breeds on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Pacific</a> coasts of the southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">USA</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">winters</a> south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a>.
This species breeds in very dense colonies on coasts and islands, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montague_Island_(Mexico)" title="Montague Island (Mexico)" class="mw-redirect">Montague Island (Mexico)</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> and exceptionally inland on suitable large freshwater lakes close to the coast. It nests in a ground scrape and lays one to two eggs. Unlike some of the smaller white terns, it is not very aggressive toward potential predators, relying on the sheer density of the nests (often only 20â€“30&nbsp;cm apart) and nesting close to other more aggressive species such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heermann%27s_Gull" title="Heermann's Gull">Heermann's Gulls</a> to avoid predation.
The Elegant Tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, almost invariably from the sea, like most <i>Thalasseus</i> terns. It usually dives directly, and not from the "stepped-hover" favoured by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Tern" title="Arctic Tern">Arctic Tern</a>. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.
Surprisingly, this Pacific species has wandered to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> as a rare vagrant on a number of occasions, and has interbred with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich_Tern" title="Sandwich Tern">Sandwich Tern</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>; there is also one record from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town" title="Cape Town">Cape Town</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> in January 2006, the first record for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>.
This is a medium-large tern, with a long, slender orange bill, pale grey upperparts and white underparts. Its legs are black. In winter, the forehead becomes white. Juvenile Elegant Terns have a scalier pale grey back. The call is a characteristic loud grating noise like a Sandwich Tern.
This bird could be confused with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Tern" title="Royal Tern">Royal Tern</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forster%27s_Tern" title="Forster's Tern">Forster's Tern</a>, but the <i>elegans</i> is larger and thicker-billed and shows more white on the forehead in winter. Out of range, it can also be easily confused with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Crested_Tern" title="Lesser Crested Tern">Lesser Crested Tern</a>.
