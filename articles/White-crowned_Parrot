The <b>White-crowned Parrot</b> (<i>Pionus senilis</i>), also known as the <b>White-crowned Pionus</b> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviculture" title="Aviculture">aviculture</a>, is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot" title="Parrot">parrot</a> which is a resident breeding species from eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a>.
It is found in lowlands and foothills locally up to 1600&nbsp;m altitude in forest canopy and edges, and adjacent semi-open woodland and second growth. The 3-6 white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> are laid in an unlined nest, usually a natural cavity in a tree or a hollow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecaceae" title="Arecaceae">palm</a> stub.
The White-crowned Parrot is 24&nbsp;cm long and weighs 220&nbsp;g. The adult male has a white forehead and crown, the feature which, likened to an old manâ€™s white hair, gave rise to the specific name <i>senilis</i>. The throat is white, and the rest of the head, neck and breast are dull dark blue. The belly is light green, and the upperparts are dark green, with a yellow-olive shoulder patch. In flight, the blue underwings and red vent are conspicuous features.
The female White-crowned Parrot is similar to the male, but the blue plumage fades into scaling on the lower breast and the shoulder patch is duller. Young birds have little blue on the head and neck or red on the undertail, and the crown feathers are green edged with white.
The White-crowned Parrot feeds in social flocks of 30-50 birds, which may wander outside the breeding range once nesting has finished. It feeds on taking various seeds, nuts and fruits, and can be pest in crops of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">corn</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorghum" title="Sorghum">sorghum</a>, and commercial fruit plantations.
It can be unobtrusive when feeding since it is slow-moving, usually silent, and keeps in the canopy. However, at rest it often perches conspicuously at the top of an unopened palm frond.
