<i>Colymbus aalge</i> <small>Pontoppidan, 1763</small>
The <b>Common Murre</b> or <b>Common Guillemot</b> (<i>Uria aalge</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auk" title="Auk">auk</a>. It is also known as the <b>Thin-billed Murre</b> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. It has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarctic" title="Subarctic">circumpolar</a> distribution, occurring in low-Arctic and boreal waters in the North-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic" title="Atlantic" class="mw-redirect">Atlantic</a> and North <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Pacific</a>. It spends most of its time at sea, only coming to land to breed on rocky cliff shores or islands.
Common Murres have fast direct flight but are not very agile. They are more manoeuvrable underwater, typically diving to depths of 30–60&nbsp;m (100–200&nbsp;ft), and depths of up to 180&nbsp;m (600&nbsp;ft) have been recorded.
Common Murres breed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_colony" title="Bird colony">colonies</a> at high densities, nesting pairs may be in bodily contact with their neighbours. They make no nest, their single egg is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubated</a> on a bare rock ledge on a cliff face. Eggs hatch after ~30 days incubation. The chick is born <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_feather" title="Down feather">downy</a>, and can regulate its body temperature after 10 days. Some 20 days after hatching the chick leaves its nesting ledge and heads for the sea, unable to fly, but gliding for some distance with fluttering wings, accompanied by its male parent. Chicks are capable of diving as soon as they hit the water. The female stays at the nest site for some 14 days after the chick has left.
Both male and female Common Murres moult after breeding and become flightless for 1–2 months. In southern populations they occasionally return to the nest site throughout the winter. Northern populations spend the winter farther from their colonies.
The auks are a family of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabirds</a> related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gulls</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">terns</a> which contains several genera.

The plumage of first winter birds is the same as the adult basic plumage. However, the first pre-alternate moult occurs later in the year. The adult pre-alternate moult is December–February, (even starting as early as November in <i>U. a. albionis</i>). First year birds can be in basic plumage as late as May, and their alternate plumage can retain some white feathers around the throat.<sup id="cite_ref-mullarney1999_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mullarney1999-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>

This bird is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird#Pursuit_diving" title="Seabird">pursuit-diver</a> that forages for food by swimming underwater using its wings for propulsion. Dives usually last less than one minute, but the bird swims underwater for distances of over 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) on a regular basis. Diving depths up to 152&nbsp;m (500&nbsp;ft) have been recorded<sup id="cite_ref-LPZCommonMurre_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LPZCommonMurre-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> and birds can remain underwater a couple of minutes.
The breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a> is islands, rocky shores, cliffs and sea stacks. The range is:

The Common Guillemot has a variety of calls, including a soft purring noise.
This species nests in densely-packed colonies (known as "loomeries"), with up to twenty pairs occupying one square metre at peak season. Common Murres do not make nests and lay their eggs on bare rock ledges, under rocks, or the ground. They first breed at four to six years old and average lifespan is about 20 years.
Immature birds return to the natal colony, but from age 5 onwards ~25% of birds leave the colony, perhaps dispersing to other colonies.<sup id="cite_ref-harris2007_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-harris2007-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup>

Courtship displays including bowing, billing and mutual preening. The male points its head vertically and makes croaking and growling noises to attract the females. The species is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a>, but pairs may split if breeding is unsuccessful.<sup id="cite_ref-kokko2004_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-kokko2004-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-moody2005_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moody2005-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup>
Common Murre eggs are large (around 11% of female weight<sup id="cite_ref-gaston1998_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gaston1998-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>), and are pointed at one end. There are a few theories to explain their <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pyriform" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:pyriform">pyriform</a> shape:
Eggs are laid between May and July for the Atlantic populations and March to July for those in the Pacific. The female spends less time ashore during the two weeks before laying. When laying, she assumes a "phoenix-like" posture: her body raised upright on vertical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsi</a>; wings half out-stretched. The egg emerges point first and laying usually takes 5–10 minutes.<sup id="cite_ref-harris2006_26-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-harris2006-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup>
The eggs vary in colour and pattern to help the parents recognize them, each egg's pattern being unique. Colours include white, green, blue or brown with spots or speckles in black or lilac. After laying, the female will look at the egg before starting the first incubation shift.<sup id="cite_ref-harris2006_26-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-harris2006-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> Both parents incubate the egg for the 28 to 34 days to hatching in shifts of 1–38 hours.<sup id="cite_ref-gaston1998_15-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gaston1998-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
Eggs can be lost due to predation or carelessness. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvidae" title="Corvidae">Crows</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">Gulls</a> are opportunist egg thieves. Eggs are also knocked from ledges during fights. If the first egg is lost, the female may lay a second egg. This egg is usually lighter than the first, with a lighter yolk. Chicks from second eggs grow quicker than those from first eggs. However this rapid growth comes at a cost, first chicks have larger fat reserves and can withstand temporary shortages of food.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from January 2012">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The fish is held lengthways in the adult's bill, with the fish's tail hanging from the end of the beak. The returning adult will form its wings into a 'tent' to protect the chick. The adult points its head downwards and the chick swallows the fish head first.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloparenting" title="Alloparenting">Alloparenting</a> behaviour is frequently observed. Non-breeding and failed breeders show great interest in other chicks, and will attempt to brood or feed them. This activity is more common as the chicks get older and begin to explore their ledge.

At time of extreme food stress, the social activity of the breeding ledge can break down. On the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_May" title="Isle of May">Isle of May</a> colony in 2007, food availability was low. Adults spent more of their time-budget foraging for their chicks and had to leave them unattended at times. Unattended chicks were attacked by breeding neighbour which often led to their deaths.

Nesting Common Murres are prone to two main sources of recreational disturbance: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-climbing" title="Rock-climbing" class="mw-redirect">rock-climbing</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdwatching" title="Birdwatching">birdwatching</a>.

When Common Murres are feeding their young, they return with one fish at a time. The provisioning time relates to the distance of the feeding areas from the colony and the numbers of available fish.
