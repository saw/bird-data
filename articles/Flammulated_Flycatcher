The <b>Flammulated Flycatcher</b> (<i>Deltarhynchus flammulatus</i>) is a species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannidae" title="Tyrannidae" class="mw-redirect">Tyrannidae</a> family and is the only species in the monotypic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><b>Deltarhynchus</b></i>, although it is closely related to the birds of the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myiarchus" title="Myiarchus">Myiarchus</a></i>. It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism" title="Endemism">endemic</a> to the dry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_forest" title="Deciduous forest" class="mw-redirect">deciduous forest</a>, arid thorn forest, and scrubby woodland of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>’s Pacific coast. The flycatcher is an olive to gray-brown bird with a streaked, pale gray chest, white throat, black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a>, dark gray feet, and dark brown wings. It is a skulking bird that typically remains hidden in the underbrush. It feeds by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleaning_(birds)" title="Gleaning (birds)">gleaning</a> insects off of leaves and twigs that it spots from an exposed perch. The female lays approximately three eggs in a nest made in a shallow tree cavity.
The species was first described in 1875 by ornithologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Newbold_Lawrence" title="George Newbold Lawrence">George Newbold Lawrence</a>, who placed this species in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myiarchus" title="Myiarchus">Myiarchus</a></i>.

<i>Deltarhynchus</i> is similar to the genus <i>Myiarchus</i>, but is distinguished from it by a broader and shorter bill, more rounded wings, a different face pattern, pale cinnamon wing and tail edgings, voice, streaking on the chest, and the bird's skulking habits.<sup id="cite_ref-Lanyon_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lanyon-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Howell_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Howell-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The Flammulated Flycatcher's generic name is derived from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words <i>delta</i>, which means 'delta-shaped' or, in this case, 'wedge', and <i>rhynchos</i>, which means 'beak'.<sup id="cite_ref-Liddell1980_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Liddell1980-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Its specific epithet is derived from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word <i>flammula</i>, which means 'little flame'.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The flycatcher has no subspecies.

This flycatcher is a sluggish and skulking species that usually remains in the underbrush.<sup id="cite_ref-Howell_4-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Howell-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> When excited either by an intruder or when attempting to attract a mate, this species raises the feathers on its crown to form what appears to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(feathers)" title="Crest (feathers)">crest</a>; however, unlike the closely related genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myiarchus" title="Myiarchus">Myiarchus</a></i>, it does not bob its head while displaying the crest.<sup id="cite_ref-Lanyon_3-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lanyon-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Flammulated Flycatcher forages by perching on an open branch and looking outward and downward for prey, which primarily consists of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>. Once it spots a potential meal, the flycatcher rapidly and directly flies at the insect, which is normally on the exposed upper surface of a leaf or twig.<sup id="cite_ref-Lanyon_3-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lanyon-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> It hovers briefly before the insect before grabbing it in its beak and flying away to typically a new perch.<sup id="cite_ref-Lanyon_3-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lanyon-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The flycatcher breeds around June of each year.
