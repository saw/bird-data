The <b>Ashy Storm Petrel</b> (<i>Oceanodroma homochroa</i>) is a small, scarce <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm-petrel" title="Storm-petrel" class="mw-redirect">storm-petrel</a> family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrobatidae" title="Hydrobatidae" class="mw-redirect">Hydrobatidae</a>. It breeds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird_colony" title="Seabird colony" class="mw-redirect">colonially</a> on islands off the coasts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, and is one of six species of storm petrel that live and feed in the rich <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Current" title="California Current">California Current</a> system.
The Ashy Storm Petrel was first described by American ornithologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Coues" title="Elliott Coues">Elliott Coues</a> in 1864. Both its common and scientific name, <i>homochroa</i>, "uniformly colored", from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> (h)omoia (<i>όμοια</i>), "alike" + "chroma" (<i>χρώμα</i>) "color", come from its coloration. One authority<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from October 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> has suggested naming it Coues's Storm Petrel after its describer.
This is a small, uniformly sooty-brown storm petrel with a forked tail, closely resembling the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Storm_Petrel" title="Black Storm Petrel">Black Storm Petrel</a>, however it is smaller and has a more fluttering style of flight, with the upstroke only becoming horizontal to the body before beginning the downstroke (other storm-petrels in its range have a higher upstroke).
It is a gregarious bird at sea, feeding nocturnally on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod" title="Cephalopod">cephalopods</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> (particularly the deep sea <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myctophid" title="Myctophid" class="mw-redirect">myctophids</a>, which rise to the sea's surface at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_animal" title="Nocturnal animal" class="mw-redirect">night</a>) and euphausiid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill" title="Krill">krill</a> such as <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Thysanoessa_spinifera&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Thysanoessa spinifera (page does not exist)">Thysanoessa spinifera</a></i>, which also swarm at the surface. They will also attend fishing vessels for the fish oils released when the nets are pulled.
Ashy Storm Petrels nest in rock burrows on offshore islands, returning to the nests at night. The species has a long breeding cycle, laying eggs in May and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledging</a> in October, although timing varies greatly, more so than in most other storm-petrels: some pairs may have a chick that is half grown when other pairs are still laying. Like in many other seabirds, pairs show both mate and site fidelity, mating in the same pair with the same mate for many years and nesting at the same burrow, despite the pairs spending their lives out of the breeding season separate from each other, and despite the fact that many individuals might seem to compete for burrows at the nesting colonies. A change in mate is usually associated with a change in nesting site.
The Ashy Storm Petrel is a long-lived bird; a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_ringing" title="Bird ringing">banded</a> individual has lived at least 31 years.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
Ashy Storm Petrel breeds on 17 islands in the northeast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Pacific</a>, principally off the coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, but including a few sites off the coast of northwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Half the world's population nests on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Islands" title="Farallon Islands">Farallon Islands</a> near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Other breeding islands include the 8 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands_of_California" title="Channel Islands of California">Channel Islands of California</a> and a small population on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronado_Islands" title="Coronado Islands">Coronados</a>. Outside of the breeding season it is believed to be more widely distributed, foraging on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Current" title="California Current">California Current</a>, but it undertakes no large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migration</a> and doesn't range as far as other species of storm-petrel. In the early fall large flocks can be seen in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Bay" title="Monterey Bay">Monterey Bay</a>. The birds do not range inland any significant distance except when storm-blown; for example a record for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Mateo_County,_California" title="San Mateo County, California">San Mateo County, California</a> was considered "unusual" by an experienced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalist" title="Naturalist" class="mw-redirect">naturalist</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The world population is estimated to be around 10,000 birds, 8,000 of them breeders, the Farallon population having declined by one third between 1972 and 1992. The Ashy Storm Petrel is designated as a species of conservation concern in California. It is threatened by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Gull" title="Western Gull">Western Gull</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrowing_Owl" title="Burrowing Owl">Burrowing Owl</a> predation, illumination from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing" title="Fishing">fishing</a> boats, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species" title="Introduced species">introduced predators</a> such as rats and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_cat" title="Feral cat">feral cats</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a>. Most of the islands that it breeds on are covered by some degree of protection.
