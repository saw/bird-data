The <b>Eurasian Dotterel</b> (<i>Charadrius morinellus</i>), or in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> just <b>Dotterel</b>, is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">wader</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plover" title="Plover">plover</a> family of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a>. It breeds in the Arctic tundra of northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a> to eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>, and on suitable mountain plateaus such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> highlands and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps" title="Alps">Alps</a>. It nests in a bare ground scrape and lays two to four eggs.
This species is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering in a narrow belt across north <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> eastwards to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>. Migration stopovers are traditional, and small parties (<i>trips</i>) of Dotterels pass through each year at these usually inland arable or grassy sites. The winter habitat is semi-desert.
This plover is smaller and more compact than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Golden_Plover" title="Eurasian Golden Plover" class="mw-redirect">Eurasian Golden Plover</a>. It has a striking whitish supercilium in all plumages and has plain wings in flight. Adults in summer are unmistakable, with a chestnut breast bordered above with white, black belly and warm brown back. The legs are yellow, and the short bill is black. As with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalarope" title="Phalarope">phalaropes</a>, the female is brighter than the male. The male Dotterel generally is responsible for incubation and looks after the chicks. In most cases the cock dotterel successfully prevents other males from getting his mate and fertilizing her eggs. He usually rears chicks that he has fathered and only 4.6% (2/44) of chicks were not the genetic offspring of the caring male, corresponding to 9.1% (2/22) broods affected.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Winter birds lack the rich underpart colouration, apart from the white breast line, and are greyer above. Young birds are similar but have a scaly appearance to their backs. The Dotterel's food is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and other small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a> such as snails and worms and shellfish. These are obtained by a run-and-pause technique, rather than the steady probing of some other wader groups. The flight call is a soft <i>pyurr</i>. The female's song is a simple repetitive whistle.
The Eurasian Dotterel is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEWA" title="AEWA" class="mw-redirect">AEWA</a>) applies.
The Dotterel has long been considered tame and unsuspecting. This led to it being easy prey for illegal collection of the bird, which depleted its stocks. Another consequence of the friendly and trusting nature of this bird has caused the name 'dotterel' in English to carry a negative connotation. The term 'dotterel' is a contemptuous label used to describe somebody who is considered to be a doting old fool.
