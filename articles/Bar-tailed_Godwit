The Bar-tailed Godwit is a relatively short-legged species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwit" title="Godwit">godwit</a>. The bill-to-tail length is 37–41&nbsp;cm, with a wingspan of 70–80&nbsp;cm. Males average smaller than females but with much overlap; males weigh 190–400&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram" title="Gram">g</a>, while females weigh 260–630&nbsp;g; there is also some regional variation in size (see subspecies, below). The adult has blue-grey legs and a very long dark bill with a slight upward curve and pink at the tip. The neck, breast and belly are unbroken brick red in breeding plumage, off white in winter. The back is mottled grey.<sup id="cite_ref-hbw_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hbw-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-bwpc_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bwpc-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
It is distinguished from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-tailed_Godwit" title="Black-tailed Godwit">Black-tailed Godwit</a> (<i>Limosa limosa</i>) by its barred, rather than wholly black, tail and a lack of white wing bars.

It forages by probing in mudflats or marshes. It may find insects by sight in short vegetation. It eats mainly insects and crustaceans, but also parts of aquatic plants.
The Bar-tailed Godwit is a non-breeding migrant in Australia. Breeding take place each year in Scandinavia, northern Asia, and Alaska. The nest is a shallow cup in moss sometimes lined with vegetation. Both sexes share incubation of the eggs and care for the young.

It was shown in 2007 to undertake the longest non-stop flight of any bird. Birds in New Zealand were tagged and tracked by satellite to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Sea" title="Yellow Sea">Yellow Sea</a> in China. According to Dr. Clive Minton (Australasian Wader Studies Group) "The distance between these two locations is 9,575 kilometres (5,950&nbsp;mi), but the actual track flown by the bird was 11,026 kilometres (6,851&nbsp;mi). This was the longest known non-stop flight of any bird. The flight took approximately nine days. At least three other Bar-tailed Godwits also appear to have reached the Yellow Sea after non-stop flights from New Zealand."<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
One specific female of the flock, nicknamed "E7", flew onward from China to Alaska and stayed there for the breeding season. Then on 29 August 2007 she departed on a non-stop flight from the Avinof Peninsula in western Alaska to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piako_River" title="Piako River">Piako River</a> near Thames New Zealand, setting a new known flight record of 11,680 kilometres (7,258&nbsp;mi).<sup id="cite_ref-gill_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gill-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Stray birds from Europe and Asia occasionally appear on both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> coasts.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from October 2008">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
