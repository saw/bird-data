<i>Larus philadelphia</i>
The <b>Bonaparte's Gull</b> (<i>Chroicocephalus philadelphia</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gull</a>.
The Bonaparte's Gull is a small species, larger only than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Gull" title="Little Gull">Little Gull</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saunders%27s_Gull" title="Saunders's Gull">Saunders's Gull</a> among all gull species.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Adults are 28–38 cm (11–15 in) long with a 76–84 cm (30–33 in) wingspan and a body mass of 162–270 g (5.7–9.5 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> They have a black hood and a short thin dark bill. The body is mainly white with pale grey back and upper wings. The underwing is pale and the wing tips are dark. They have orange legs. In winter, the head is white.
In their first summer, the appearance of Bonaparte's Gull is similar to that in its first winter, but paler due to wear. Fewer than 5% of Bonaparte's Gulls acquire a dark hood in their first summer, and on those that do, the hood is duller than on breeding adults.
Their breeding habitat is near bogs or lakes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">coniferous</a> forest across western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>. They nest in conifers, sometimes on the ground.
They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> and most move east or west to coastal waters, also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>. They are rare vagrants to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, where they usually associate with the somewhat larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-headed_Gull" title="Black-headed Gull">Black-headed Gulls</a>.
These birds forage in flight or pick up objects while swimming or wading. They mainly eat insects, crustaceans and fish. Unlike some other gulls, this bird rarely scavenges.
They are graceful in flight, more like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terns" title="Terns" class="mw-redirect">terns</a>. They were named after Prince <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lucien_Bonaparte" title="Charles Lucien Bonaparte">Charles Lucien Bonaparte</a>, a zoologist and nephew of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France" title="Napoleon I of France" class="mw-redirect">Napoleon</a>.
Formerly known as <i>Larus philadelphia</i>, the Bonaparte's Gull was moved to the genus <i>Chroicocephalus</i> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> in July, 2008.
