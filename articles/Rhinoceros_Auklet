The <b>Rhinoceros Auklet</b> (<i>Cerorhinca monocerata</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> and a close relative of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffin" title="Puffin">puffins</a>. It is the only living species of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i>Cerorhinca</i>. Given its close relationship with the puffins, the common name <b>Rhinoceros Puffin</b> has been proposed for the species.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
It ranges widely across the North Pacific, feeding on small fish and nesting in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_colony" title="Bird colony">seabird colonies</a>. Its name is derived from a horn-like extension of the beak. This horn is only present in breeding adults, and like the elaborate sheath on the bill of puffins is shed every year.
The Rhinoceros Auklet (also known as the Rhino Auklet, Horn-billed Puffin, or Unicorn Puffin), is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auk" title="Auk">auk</a> with a large, strong, orange/brown bill (with the 'horn' protruding from it). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> is dark on top and paler below; breeding adults (both male and female) possess white plumes above the eyes and behind the bill. Males are slightly larger than females (about 10% in mass).
The Rhinoceros Auklet is a North Pacific auk that breeds from California (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands_(California)" title="Channel Islands (California)" class="mw-redirect">Channel Islands</a>) to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleutian_Islands" title="Aleutian Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> in North America; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaid%C5%8D" title="Hokkaidō" class="mw-redirect">Hokkaidō</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honsh%C5%AB" title="Honshū" class="mw-redirect">Honshū</a>, Japan, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakhalin_Island" title="Sakhalin Island" class="mw-redirect">Sakhalin Island</a> in Asia. It winters both in offshore and inshore waters, exhibiting some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migration</a>.
The Rhinoceros Auklet nests in burrows dug into the soil, or in natural caves and cavities between 1 and 5 m deep. It prefers nesting sites on slight inclines to aid take-off, as it is a poor flier. A single egg is incubated by both parents for 45 days. The <a href="/w/index.php?title=Semiprecocial&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Semiprecocial (page does not exist)">semiprecocial</a> chick is then fed each night with a bill full of fish (in the manner of puffins) for 50 days; this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal" title="Nocturnal" class="mw-redirect">nocturnal</a> behaviour is believed to be a response to predation and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptoparasitism" title="Kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitism</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gulls</a>.
At sea, Rhinoceros Auklets feed on fish, with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill" title="Krill">krill</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid" title="Squid">squid</a> taken also. They feed inshore during the breeding season in the midwater. To catch their prey, they dive as deeply as 57 meters (187&nbsp;ft) for as long as 148 seconds.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The genus <i>Cerorhinca</i> evolved in the North Pacific, apparently in the mid-late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene" title="Miocene">Miocene</a>. Although today only one species remains, it used to be much more diverse, both in number of species and in distribution. Fossils have been found as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California" title="Baja California">Baja California</a>. The first record of the clade from the Atlantic Ocean was reported by Smith et al. (2007) and suggests that the biogeographic history of <i>Cerorhinca</i> is more complex than previously thought.
