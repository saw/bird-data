The <b>Mourning Dove</b> (<i>Zenaida macroura</i>) is a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dove" title="Dove" class="mw-redirect">dove</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> (Columbidae). The bird is also called the <b>Turtle Dove</b> or the <b>American Mourning Dove</b> or <b>Rain Dove</b>, and formerly was known as the <b>Carolina Pigeon</b> or <b>Carolina Turtledove</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It is one of the most abundant and widespread of all North American birds. It is also the leading gamebird, with more than 20 million birds (up to 70 million in some years) shot annually in the U.S., both for sport and for meat. Its ability to sustain its population under such pressure stems from its prolific breeding: in warm areas, one pair may raise up to six <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring" title="Offspring">broods</a> a year. Its plaintive <i>woo-OO-oo-oo-oo</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_song" title="Bird song" class="mw-redirect">call</a> gives the bird its name. The wings can make an unusual whistling sound upon take-off and landing. The bird is a strong <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_flight" title="Bird flight">flier</a>, capable of speeds up to 88&nbsp;km/h (55&nbsp;mph).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Mourning Doves are light grey and brown and generally muted in color. Males and females are similar in appearance. The species is generally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a>, with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents incubate and care for the young. Mourning Doves eat almost exclusively seeds, but the young are fed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_milk" title="Crop milk">crop milk</a> by their parents.
The Mourning Dove is closely related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eared_Dove" title="Eared Dove">Eared Dove</a> (<i>Zenaida auriculata</i>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socorro_Dove" title="Socorro Dove">Socorro Dove</a> (<i>Zenaida graysoni</i>). Some authorities describe them as forming a superspecies and these three birds are sometimes classified in the separate genus <i>Zenaidura</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-AOU_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AOU-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> but the current classification has them as separate species in the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenaida_doves" title="Zenaida doves">Zenaida</a></i>. In addition, the Socorro Dove has at times been considered conspecific with the Mourning Dove, although several differences in behavior, call, and appearance justify separation as two different species.<sup id="cite_ref-Checklist225_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Checklist225-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> While the three species do form a subgroup of <i>Zenaida</i>, using a separate genus would interfere with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophyly" title="Monophyly">monophyly</a> of <i>Zenaida</i> by making it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly" title="Paraphyly">paraphyletic</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-AOU_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AOU-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Mourning Dove is a medium-sized, slender dove approximately 31&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) in length. Mourning Doves weigh 4–6 ounces, usually closer to 4.5 ounces.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_flight" title="Bird flight">elliptical wings</a> are broad, and the head is rounded. Its tail is long and tapered ("macroura" comes from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> words for "large" and "tail"<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>). Mourning Doves have perching feet, with three toes forward and one reversed. The legs are short and reddish colored. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">beak</a> is short and dark, usually a brown-black hue.<sup id="cite_ref-National_Geographic_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-National_Geographic-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> is generally light gray-brown and lighter and pinkish below. The wings have black spotting, and the outer tail <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather" title="Feather">feathers</a> are white, contrasting with the black inners. Below the eye is a distinctive crescent-shaped area of dark feathers. The eyes are dark, with light skin surrounding them.<sup id="cite_ref-National_Geographic_6-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-National_Geographic-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The adult male has bright purple-pink patches on the neck sides, with light pink coloring reaching the breast. The crown of the adult male is a distinctly bluish-grey color. Females are similar in appearance, but with more brown coloring overall. The iridescent feather patches on the neck above the shoulders are nearly absent, but can be quite vivid on males. Juvenile birds have a scaly appearance, and are generally darker.<sup id="cite_ref-National_Geographic_6-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-National_Geographic-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
All five subspecies of the Mourning Dove look similar and are not easily distinguishable.<sup id="cite_ref-National_Geographic_6-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-National_Geographic-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The nominate subspecies possesses shorter wings, and is darker and more buff-colored than the "average" Mourning Dove. <i>Z. m. carolinensis</i> has longer wings and toes, a shorter beak, and is darker in color. The Western subspecies has longer wings, a longer beak, shorter toes, and is more muted and lighter in color. The Panama Mourning Dove has shorter wings and legs, a longer beak, and is grayer in color. The Clarion Island subspecies possesses larger feet, a larger beak, and is darker brown in color.<sup id="cite_ref-NRCS_p3_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NRCS_p3-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Mourning Dove occupies a wide variety of open and semi-open habitats, such as urban areas, farms, prairie, grassland, and lightly wooded areas. It avoids <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp" title="Swamp">swamps</a> and thick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forest</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaufman_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kaufman-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> The species has adapted well to areas altered by humans. It commonly nests in trees in cities or near farmsteads.
Most Mourning Doves <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> along <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyway" title="Flyway">flyways</a> over land. On rare occasions, mourning doves have been seen flying over the Gulf of Mexico; but this is exceptional. Spring migration north runs from March to May. Fall migration south runs from September to November, with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males.<sup id="cite_ref-NRCS_p2_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NRCS_p2-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Migration is usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaufman_13-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kaufman-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> However, not all individuals migrate. Even in Canada some mourning doves remain through winter, sustained by the presence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_feeder" title="Bird feeder">bird feeders</a>.
This species' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_song" title="Bird song" class="mw-redirect">call</a> is a distinctive, plaintive <i>cooOOoo-woo-woo-woooo</i>, uttered by males to attract a mate, and may be mistaken for the call of an owl at first. (Close up, a grating or throat-rattling sound may be heard preceding the first coo.) Other sounds include a nest call (<i>cooOOoo</i>) by paired males to attract their mates to the nest sites, a greeting call (a soft <i>ork</i>) by males upon rejoining their mates, and an alarm call (a short <i>roo-oo</i>) by either male or female when threatened. In flight, the wings make a fluttery whistling sound that is hard to hear. The wing whistle is much louder and more noticeable upon take-off and landing.<sup id="cite_ref-National_Geographic_6-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-National_Geographic-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship#Courtship_in_the_animal_kingdom" title="Courtship">Courtship</a> begins with a noisy flight by the male, followed by a graceful, circular glide with outstretched wings and head down. After landing, the male will approach the female with a puffed out breast, bobbing head, and loud calls. Mated pairs will often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_grooming" title="Personal grooming">preen</a> each other's feathers.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaufman_13-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kaufman-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
The male then leads the female to potential nest sites, and the female will choose one. The female dove builds the nest. The male will fly about, gather material, and bring it to her. The male will stand on the female's back and give the material to the female, who then builds it into the nest.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> The nest is constructed of twigs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinophyta#Foliage" title="Pinophyta">conifer needles</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae#Structure_and_growth" title="Poaceae">grass blades</a>, and is of flimsy construction.<sup id="cite_ref-NRCS_p3_7-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NRCS_p3-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Mourning doves will sometimes requisition the unused nests of other Mourning Doves, other birds, or arboreal mammals such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel" title="Squirrel">squirrels</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-NRCS_p4_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NRCS_p4-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>
Most nests are in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trees" title="Trees" class="mw-redirect">trees</a>, both deciduous and coniferous. Sometimes, they can be found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub" title="Shrub">shrubs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine" title="Vine">vines</a>, or on artificial constructs like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buildings" title="Buildings" class="mw-redirect">buildings</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-NRCS_p3_7-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NRCS_p3-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> or hanging flower pots.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> When there is no suitable elevated object, Mourning Doves will nest on the ground.<sup id="cite_ref-NRCS_p3_7-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NRCS_p3-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The clutch size is almost always two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_17-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> Occasionally, however, a female will lay her eggs in the nest of another pair, leading to three or four eggs in the nest.<sup id="cite_ref-NRCS_p1_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NRCS_p1-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> The eggs are white, 6.6 ml, 2.57–2.96&nbsp;cm long, 2.06–2.30&nbsp;cm wide, 6–7 g at laying (5–6% of female body mass). Both sexes incubate, the male from morning to afternoon, and the female the rest of the day and at night. Mourning Doves are devoted parents; nests are very rarely left unattended by the adults.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_17-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> When flushed from the nest, an incubating parent may perform a nest-distraction display, or a broken-wing display, fluttering on the ground as if injured, then flying away when the predator approaches it.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">Incubation</a> takes two weeks. The hatched young, called squabs, are strongly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" title="Altricial">altricial</a>, being helpless at hatching and covered with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_feather" title="Down feather">down</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_17-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> Both parents feed the squabs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_milk" title="Crop milk">pigeon's milk</a> (dove's milk) for the first 3–4 days of life. Thereafter, the crop milk is gradually augmented by seeds. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledging" title="Fledging" class="mw-redirect">Fledging</a> takes place in about 11–15 days, before the squabs are fully grown but after they are capable of digesting adult food.<sup id="cite_ref-NRCS_p4_18-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NRCS_p4-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> They stay nearby to be fed by their father for up to two weeks after fledging.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaufman_13-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kaufman-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
Mourning Doves are prolific breeders. In warmer areas, these birds may raise up to six broods in a season.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaufman_13-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kaufman-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> This fast breeding is essential because mortality is high.

The Mourning Dove is monogamous and forms strong pair bonds.<sup id="cite_ref-NRCS_p1_19-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NRCS_p1-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Pairs typically reconvene in the same area the following breeding season, and sometimes may remain together throughout the winter. However, lone doves will find new partners if necessary.
Mourning Doves eat almost exclusively <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a>, which make up more than 99% of their diet. Rarely, they will eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail" title="Snail">snails</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>. Mourning Doves generally eat enough to fill their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_(anatomy)" title="Crop (anatomy)">crops</a> and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel" title="Gravel">gravel</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand" title="Sand">sand</a> to assist with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion" title="Digestion">digestion</a>.

Like other columbids, the Mourning Dove drinks by suction, without lifting or tilting its head. It often gathers at drinking spots around dawn and dusk.
Mourning doves sunbathe or rainbathe by lying on the ground or on a flat tree limb, leaning over, stretching one wing, and keeping this posture for up to twenty minutes. These birds can also waterbathe in shallow pools or bird baths. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_bath" title="Dust bath">Dustbathing</a> is common as well.
Outside the breeding season, Mourning Doves roost communally in dense deciduous trees or in conifers. During sleep, the head rests between the shoulders, close to the body; it is not tucked under the shoulder feathers as in many other species. During the winter in Canada, roosting flights to the roosts in the evening, and out of the roosts in the morning, are delayed on colder days.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup>
