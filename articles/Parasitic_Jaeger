The <b>Parasitic Jaeger</b>, also known as the <b>Arctic Skua</b> or <b>Parasitic Skua</b>, (<i>Stercorarius parasiticus</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skua" title="Skua">skua</a> family Stercorariidae.
This species breeds in the north of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and North America, with significant populations as far south as northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. It nests on dry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a>, higher fells and islands, laying up to four olive-brown eggs. It is usually silent except for newing and wailing notes while on the breeding grounds. Like other skuas, it will fly at the head of a human or fox approaching its nest. Although it cannot inflict serious damage, it is a frightening and painful experience. It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrant</a>, wintering at sea in the tropics and southern oceans.
In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, they breed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland" title="Shetland">Shetland</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkney" title="Orkney">Orkney</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Hebrides" title="Outer Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland" title="Sutherland">Sutherland</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caithness" title="Caithness">Caithness</a>, and some islands in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll_and_Bute" title="Argyll and Bute">Argyll</a>.
This bird will feed on rodents, small birds and insects but also robs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gulls</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">terns</a> of their catches. Like the larger skua <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a>, it continues this piratical behaviour throughout the year, showing great agility as it harasses its victims.
Identification is complicated by similarities to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-tailed_Jaeger" title="Long-tailed Jaeger">Long-tailed Jaeger</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomarine_Skua" title="Pomarine Skua">Pomarine Skua</a>, and the existence of three colour morphs. Small for a skua, the Parasitic Jaeger measures 41–48 cm (16–19 in) in length, 107–125 cm (42–49 in) in wingspan and weighs 300–650 g (0.66–1.4 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CRC_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The tail streamer of the breeding adult accounts for about 7&nbsp;cm (2.8&nbsp;in) of their length. Light morph adults have a brown back, mainly white underparts and dark primary wing feathers with a white "flash". The head and neck are yellowish-white with a black cap and there is a pointed central tail projection. Dark morph adults are dark brown, and intermediate phase birds are dark with somewhat paler underparts, head and neck. All morphs have the white wing flash.
Juveniles are even more problematic, and are difficult to separate from Long-tailed Jaegers. They are bulkier, shorter-winged, and less tern-like than that species, but show the same wide range of plumage variation. The flight is more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon" title="Falcon">falcon</a>-like. However, they are usually warmer toned than Long-tailed, with browner shades, rather than grey.
