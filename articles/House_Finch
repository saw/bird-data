This is a moderately-sized finch. Adult birds are 12.5 to 15 cm (4.9 to 5.9 in) and span 20 to 25 cm (7.9 to 9.8 in). Body mass can vary from 16 to 27 g (0.56 to 0.95 oz), with an average weight of 21&nbsp;g (0.74&nbsp;oz). Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 7 to 8.4 cm (2.8 to 3.3 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail" title="Tail">tail</a> is 5.7 to 6.5 cm (2.2 to 2.6 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmen_(bird)" title="Culmen (bird)" class="mw-redirect">culmen</a> is 0.9 to 1.1 cm (0.35 to 0.43 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 1.6 to 1.8 cm (0.63 to 0.71 in).<sup id="cite_ref-cle_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cle-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Adults have a long, square-tipped brown tail and are a brown or dull-brown color across the back with some shading into deep gray on the wing feathers. Breast and belly feathers may be streaked; the flanks usually are. In most cases, adult males' heads, necks and shoulders are reddish.<sup id="cite_ref-Sibley_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sibley-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-H.26W_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-H.26W-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> This color sometimes extends to the belly and down the back, between the wings. Male coloration varies in intensity with the seasons<sup id="cite_ref-IV_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IV-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> and is derived from the berries and fruits in its diet.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> As a result, the colors range from pale straw-yellow through bright orange (both rare) to deep, intense red. Adult females have brown upperparts and streaked underparts.
Their song is a rapid, cheery warble or a variety of chirps.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from August 2011">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Originally only a resident of Mexico and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">southwestern United States</a>, they were introduced to eastern North America in the 1940s.

House Finches forage on the ground or in vegetation normally. They primarily eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain" title="Grain" class="mw-redirect">grains</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry" title="Berry">berries</a>, being voracious consumers of weed seeds such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nettle" title="Nettle">nettle</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandelion" title="Dandelion" class="mw-redirect">dandelion</a>; included are incidental small insects such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphid" title="Aphid">aphids</a>.

The House Finch is known to damage orchard fruit and consume commercially grown grain, but is generally not considered a significant pest, rather an annoyance.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
Nests are made in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest#Cavity" title="Bird nest">cavities</a>, including openings in buildings, hanging plants, and other cup-shaped outdoor decorations. Sometimes nests abandoned by other birds are used. Nests may be re-used for subsequent broods or in following years. The nest is built by the female, sometimes in as little as two days.<sup id="cite_ref-Evanden_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Evanden-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> It is well made of twigs and debris, forming a cup shape, usually 1.8 to 2.7 m (5.9 to 8.9 ft) above the ground.<sup id="cite_ref-Evanden_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Evanden-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
During courtship, the male will touch bills with the female. He may then present the female with choice bits of food, and if she mimics the behavior of a hungry chick, he may actually feed her. The male also feeds the female during the breeding and incubation of both eggs and young,<sup id="cite_ref-Thompson_1960_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Thompson_1960-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> and the male is the primary feeder of the fledgelings (who can be differentiated from the females by the pin feathers remaining on their heads). Females are typically attracted to the males with the deepest pigment of red to their head, more so than the occasional orange or yellowish-headed males that sometimes occur.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_6-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
The female lays clutches of eggs from February through August, two or more broods per year with 2 to 6 eggs per brood, most commonly 4 or 5. The egg laying usually takes place in the morning, at the rate of one egg per day.<sup id="cite_ref-Thompson_1960_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Thompson_1960-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> The eggs are a pale bluish green with few black spots and a smooth, somewhat glossy surface. In response to mite infestation, the mother finch may lay one gender of egg first, which increases the chances of the young finches' survival.<sup id="cite_ref-Badyaev.2C_Hamstra.2C_Oh.2C_and_Seaman_2006_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Badyaev.2C_Hamstra.2C_Oh.2C_and_Seaman_2006-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> The female incubates the eggs for 12 to 14 days.

House Finches are one of the few birds who feed their young only plant matter.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_6-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
House Finches are aggressive enough to drive other birds away from places such as feeders.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>
