The <b>American Oystercatcher</b> (<i>Haematopus palliatus</i>), occasionally called the <b>American Pied Oystercatcher</b>, is a member of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopodidae" title="Haematopodidae" class="mw-redirect">Haematopodidae</a>. The bird is marked by its black and white body and a long, thick orange beak. This shorebird is approximately 19&nbsp;inches (42 â€“ 52&nbsp;cm) in length.
The American Oystercatcher is found on the Atlantic coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a> to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>, where it is also found on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf coast</a>, and south to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>. It is found also in the Pacific coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> and northern South America. In the 19th century they became locally extinct in the northeast due to market hunting and egg collecting. After receiving protection under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act" title="Migratory Bird Treaty Act" class="mw-redirect">Migratory Bird Treaty Act</a>, their range extended northward to re-occupy historical habitat in New England.
Oystercatchers are closely tied to coastal habitats. They nest on beaches on coastal islands and feed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">marine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a>. The large, heavy beak is used to pry open bivalve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusc" title="Mollusc" class="mw-redirect">molluscs</a>. Oystercatchers raise a clutch of two or three eggs. In winter, they are found in flocks along the coast from central New Jersey to the Gulf of Mexico.
Although Oystercatcher populations are low, the species is not protected under the Endangered Species Act. Oystercatchers are listed as a species of concern in several states because of low and declining populations, and threats to coastal habitats. Threats include development and recreational use of nesting beaches.
