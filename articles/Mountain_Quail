This is not appropriate, however, as the Mountain Quail's ancestors have diverged from other New World quails earlier than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobwhites" title="Bobwhites" class="mw-redirect">bobwhites</a>, no later than 6 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mya_(unit)" title="Mya (unit)" class="mw-redirect">mya</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The bird's average length is 26–28&nbsp;cm, with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingspan" title="Wingspan">wingspan</a> of 35–40&nbsp;cm. They have relatively short, rounded wings and long, featherless legs. These birds are easily recognized by their top knots, which are shorter in the female. They have a brown face, gray breast, brown back and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remiges" title="Remiges" class="mw-redirect">primaries</a>, and heavily white barred underside.
There are five recognized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>:
It inhabits mountainous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapparal" title="Chapparal" class="mw-redirect">chapparal</a> west of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_peninsula" title="Baja peninsula" class="mw-redirect">Baja peninsula</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. It has been introduced to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and some areas of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(U.S._state)" title="Washington (U.S. state)" class="mw-redirect">Washington</a> state in the USA. It can be found up to 3000 m above sea level. It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-migratory" title="Non-migratory" class="mw-redirect">non-migratory</a> species; however some populations may be altitudinal migrants in some mountain ranges.
Mountain Quail primarily move about by walking, and can move surprisingly quickly through brush and undergrowth. In the late summer, fall and winter, the adults and immature young congregate into family groups of up to 20 birds. The birds habits can be secretive. Any flight is usually short and explosive, with many rapid wingbeats followed by a slow glide to the ground.
Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)" title="Diet (nutrition)">diet</a> consists primarily of plant matter and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a>. The chicks are decidedly more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivorous" title="Insectivorous" class="mw-redirect">insectivorous</a> than adults, gradually consuming more plant matter as they mature.
Breeding among Mountain Quail is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a>, and rarely gregarious. The female typically lays 9-10 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a> in a simple scrape concealed in vegetation, often at the base of a tree or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub" title="Shrub">shrub</a>, usually close to water. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">Incubation</a> lasts from 21–25 days, usually performed by the female and rarely by the male. The chicks are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial" title="Precocial">precocial</a>, leaving the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> with their parents within hours of hatching.
It is not considered threatened by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>, being plentiful across a wide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)" title="Range (biology)">range</a>. However, its success is tied to sufficient habitat, which expands in cooler and more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arid" title="Arid">arid</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate" title="Climate">climate</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfossil" title="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> remains have been found, for example at <a href="/w/index.php?title=Rocky_Arroyo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Rocky Arroyo (page does not exist)">Rocky Arroyo</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalupe_Mountains" title="Guadalupe Mountains">Guadalupe Mountains</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelter_Cave" title="Shelter Cave">Shelter Cave</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>, where today not enough habitat exists anymore.
