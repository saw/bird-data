An adult Calliope Hummingbird can measure 7–10 cm (2.8–3.9 in) in length, span 11&nbsp;cm (4.3&nbsp;in) across the wings and weigh 2 to 3 g (0.071 to 0.11 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-Allabout_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Allabout-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-IMNH_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IMNH-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> These birds have glossy green on the back and crown with white underparts. Their bill and tail are relatively short. The adult male has wine-red streaks on the throat, green flanks and a dark tail. Females and immatures have a pinkish wash on the flanks, dark streaks on the throat and a dark tail with white tips. The only similar birds are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufous_Hummingbird" title="Rufous Hummingbird">Rufous Hummingbird</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_Hummingbird" title="Allen's Hummingbird">Allen's Hummingbird</a>, but these birds are larger with more distinct and contrasting rufous markings on tail and flanks, and longer central tail feathers.
The breeding habitat of Calliope Hummingbird is varied open shrubby habitats. Nesting usually occurs at higher altitudes in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>.

Calliope Hummingbird is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> bird, generally leaving their breeding grounds earlier than most birds (although not as early as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufous_Hummingbird" title="Rufous Hummingbird">Rufous Hummingbird</a>) to take advantage of the late-summer wildflowers in the mountains of western North America.

These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue, drink sap from holes created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapsucker" title="Sapsucker">sapsuckers</a> or catch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_(birds)" title="Hawking (birds)">the wing</a>.

Adult males usually arrive on the breeding ground before females, from mid-April to early May. The male claims and vigorously defends a nesting territory in which he will breed with many females. The male takes no part in raising the young and often actually vacates the breeding grounds by the time the young hatch. The female usually builds an open cup nest in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">conifer</a> under an overhanging branch, though apple and alder trees have also been used. The nest is often built on the base of large pine cones and somewhat resembles a pine cone itself. A nest may be used repeatedly over the course of several years. Two eggs are laid from late May to early July and are incubated for 15 to 16 days.<sup id="cite_ref-Audubon_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Audubon-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The young are capable of flight about 20 days after hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-IMNH_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IMNH-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Many species of pollinators, including the Calliope Hummingbird, have shown decreases across the continent. Little information is available on the overall issues that are causing these declines but potential threats include habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, and replacement of native plants by invasive plants. The restricted wintering range of Calliope Hummingbirds makes the species more susceptible to natural disasters, diseases, or land use changes that could wipe out significant portions of the population. Despite its unique characteristics in the avian world, Calliope Hummingbird has not been well studied, leaving much of its life history unknown. In order for any conservation measures to be taken that would benefit this species, we need to better understand the biology and needs of this species. Partners in Pollination/Alianza para Polinizacion, a consortium of non-profit organizations, universities, and businesses, was formed in 1995 to increase awareness of the importance of pollinators to ecosystems, encourage research and conservation on plant/pollinator interactions, and influence policy related to plant/pollinator conservation.<sup id="cite_ref-Audubon_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Audubon-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
