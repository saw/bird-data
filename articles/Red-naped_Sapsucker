The <b>Red-naped Sapsucker</b> (<i>Sphyrapicus nuchalis</i>) is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a>.
Their breeding habitat is mixed forests in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Basin" title="Great Basin">Great Basin</a> areas of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. They nest in a cavity in a dead tree. Other species which nest in tree cavities reuse nests formerly used by these birds.
Throughout western North America, Red-naped Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus nuchalis) nests have been described primarily in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) with decay-softened wood. Heart-wood decay is reported to infect the roots of most aspens that red-naped sapsuckers choose to excavate for nesting.Red-naped Sapsucker's typically excavate their first cavity relatively close to the ground and over subsequent years make progressively higher excavations.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Most (68%) nest trees were live and 75% had broken tops. Western larch (Larix occidentalis) and birch were greatly over utilized compared to their availability.
This species measures 19–23 cm (7.5–9.1 in) long and weighs 32–66 g (1.1–2.3 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Adults have a black head with a red forehead, white stripes, and a red spot on the nape; they have a white lower belly and rump. They have a yellow breast and upper belly. They are black on the back and wings with white bars; they have a large white wing patch. Adult males have a red throat patch; for females, the lower part of the throat is red, the upper part white.
These birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> south and vacate areas at higher elevations.
True to their name, and like other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapsucker" title="Sapsucker">sapsuckers</a>, they drill holes in trees and eat the sap as well as insects attracted to it. They sometimes catch insects in flight; they also eat seeds and berries.
This bird used to be considered a subspecies of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-bellied_Sapsucker" title="Yellow-bellied Sapsucker">Yellow-bellied Sapsucker</a>.
Red-naped sapsuckers typically lay 3-7 white eggs.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The young are altricial, naked, and helpless. The eggs are incubated for 12–13 days and the young are able to fly and leave the nest after 25–29 days of hatching.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
To provide habitat and foraging for woodpeckers, forest management objectives on public land include snag and live tree retention. Numerous studies have shown woodpeckers will readily nest in logged areas as long as some stands are left standing. The drastic change in forest habitat cause by logging and tree retention drastically effects the quality of nesting sites and is detrimental to the red-naped sapsuckers habitat.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
