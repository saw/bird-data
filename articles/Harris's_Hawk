The <b>Harris's Hawk</b> or <b>Harris Hawk</b> (<i>Parabuteo unicinctus</i>) formerly known as the <b>Bay-winged Hawk</b> or <b>Dusky Hawk</b>, is a medium-large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">bird of prey</a> which breeds from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">southwestern United States</a> south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a> and central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>. Birds are sometimes reported at large in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a>, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Britain</a>, but it is a popular species in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry" title="Falconry">falconry</a> and these records almost certainly all refer to escapes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captivity_(animal)" title="Captivity (animal)">captivity</a>.
It is the only member of the genus <i>Parabuteo</i>. The name is derived from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> <i>para</i>, meaning beside, near or like, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>buteo</i>, referring to a kind of buzzard; <i>uni</i> meaning once; and <i>cinctus</i> meaning girdled, referring to the white band at the tip of the tail.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Audubon" title="John James Audubon">John James Audubon</a> gave this bird its English name in honor of his ornithological companion, financial supporter, and friend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Harris_(ornithologist)" title="Edward Harris (ornithologist)">Edward Harris</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The Harris Hawk is notable for its behavior of hunting cooperatively in "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack_hunter" title="Pack hunter">packs</a>", consisting of family groups while most other raptors hunt in solitary.
Individual Harris Hawks range in length from 46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 in) and generally have a wingspan of about 1.1&nbsp;m (3.6&nbsp;ft)<sup id="cite_ref-Mikos_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mikos-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> They exhibit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> with the females being larger by about 35%. In the United States, the average weight for males is about 710&nbsp;g (25&nbsp;oz), while the female average is 1,020&nbsp;g (36&nbsp;oz).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> They have dark brown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> with chestnut shoulders, wing linings, and thighs,<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> white on the base a tip of the tail,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> long, yellow legs and a yellow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cere" title="Cere" class="mw-redirect">cere</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-rappole_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rappole-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The vocalizations of the Harris's Hawk are very harsh sounds.<sup id="cite_ref-Mikos_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mikos-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The juvenile Harris Hawk is mostly streaked with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buff_(colour)" title="Buff (colour)">buff</a>, and appears much lighter than the dark adults. When in flight, the undersides of the juveniles' wings are buff-colored with brown streaking. They can look unlike adults at first glance, but the identical chestnut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> is an aid for identification.<sup id="cite_ref-rappole_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-rappole-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s) from May 2010">verification needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
There are three subspecies of Harris's Hawk:
Harris's Hawks live in sparse <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland" title="Woodland">woodland</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-desert" title="Semi-desert" class="mw-redirect">semi-desert</a>, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a> (with some trees) in some parts of their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)" title="Range (biology)">range</a> (Howell and Webb 1995), including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove" title="Mangrove">mangrove</a> swamps, as in parts of their South American range.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Harris's Hawks are permanent residents and do not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-cornell_10-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cornell-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
The diet of the Harris's Hawk consists of small creatures including birds, lizards, mammals, and large insects. Because it often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack_hunter" title="Pack hunter">hunts in groups</a>, the Harris's Hawk can also take down larger prey, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare" title="Hare">jackrabbits</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Kenn_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kenn-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
They nest in small trees, shrubby growth, or cacti. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nests</a> are often compact, made of sticks, plant roots, and stems, and are often lined with leaves, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss" title="Moss">moss</a>, bark and plant roots. They are built mainly by the female. There are usually two to four white to blueish white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a> sometimes with a speckling of pale <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown" title="Brown">brown</a> or gray. The nestlings start out light buff, but in five to six days turn a rich brown.<sup id="cite_ref-Baicich.2C_Paul_J._and_Harrison.2C_Colin_J._O._1997_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Baicich.2C_Paul_J._and_Harrison.2C_Colin_J._O._1997-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
Very often, there will be three hawks attending one nest: two males and one female.<sup id="cite_ref-Kenn_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kenn-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Whether or not this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyandry" title="Polyandry">polyandry</a> is debated, as it may be confused with backstanding (one bird standing on another's back).<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> The female does most of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubation</a>. The eggs hatch in 31 to 36 days. The young begin to explore outside the nest at 38 days, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a>, or start to fly, at 45 to 50 days. The female sometimes breeds two or three times in a year.<sup id="cite_ref-Baicich.2C_Paul_J._and_Harrison.2C_Colin_J._O._1997_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Baicich.2C_Paul_J._and_Harrison.2C_Colin_J._O._1997-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Young may stay with their parents for up to three years, helping to raise later broods.
While most raptors are solitary, only coming together for breeding and migration, Harris's Hawks will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack_hunter" title="Pack hunter">hunt in cooperative groups</a> of two to six. This is believed to be an adaptation to the desert climate in which they live. In one hunting technique, a small group flies ahead and scouts, then another group member flies ahead and scouts, and this continues until prey is bagged and shared. In another, all the hawks spread around the prey and one bird flushes it out.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
The wild Harris's Hawk population is declining due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_loss" title="Habitat loss" class="mw-redirect">habitat loss</a>; however, under some circumstances, they have been known to move into developed areas.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
Since about 1980, Harris's Hawks have been increasingly used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry" title="Falconry">falconry</a> and are now the most popular hawks in the West (outside of Asia) for that purpose, as they are one of the easiest to train and the most social.<sup id="cite_ref-cyber_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cyber-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>
