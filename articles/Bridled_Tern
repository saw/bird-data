<i>Sterna anaethetus</i> <small>Scopoli, 1786</small>
The <b>Bridled Tern</b> (<i>Onychoprion anaethetus</i>, formerly <i>Sterna anaethetus</i> - see Bridge <i>et al.</i>, 2005) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">tern</a> family Sternidae. It is a bird of the tropical oceans.
This is a medium-sized tern, at 30–32&nbsp;cm in length and with a 77–81&nbsp;cm wingspan similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Tern" title="Common Tern">Common Tern</a> in size, but more heavily built. The wings and deeply forked tail are long, and it has dark grey upperparts and white underparts. The forehead and eyebrows are white, as is a striking collar on the hindneck. It has black legs and bill. Juvenile Bridled Terns are scaly grey above and pale below.
This species is unlikely to be confused with any tern apart from the similarly dark-backed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooty_Tern" title="Sooty Tern">Sooty Tern</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectacled_Tern" title="Spectacled Tern">Spectacled Tern</a> from the Tropical Pacific. It is paler-backed than that Sooty, (but not as pale as the Grey-backed) and has a narrower white forehead and a pale neck collar.
This bird is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> and dispersive, wintering more widely through the tropical oceans. It has markedly marine habits compared to most terns.

It is a rare vagrant to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>.
This species breeds in colonies on rocky islands. It nests in a ground scrape or hole and lays one egg. It feeds by plunge-diving for fish in marine environments, but will also pick from the surface like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Tern" title="Black Tern">Black Tern</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull-billed_Tern" title="Gull-billed Tern">Gull-billed Tern</a>. It usually dives directly, and not from the "stepped-hover" favoured by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Tern" title="Arctic Tern">Arctic Tern</a>. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.
