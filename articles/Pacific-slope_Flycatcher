The <b>Pacific-slope Flycatcher</b> (<i>Empidonax difficilis</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivore" title="Insectivore">insectivorous</a> bird of the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher" title="Tyrant flycatcher">Tyrannidae</a>. It is native to coastal regions of western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and the southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Cortez" title="Sea of Cortez" class="mw-redirect">Sea of Cortez</a>, as far north as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> and southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, but is replaced in the inland regions by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordilleran_Flycatcher" title="Cordilleran Flycatcher">Cordilleran Flycatcher</a>. These two species were formerly considered a single species known as <b>Western Flycatcher</b>. In winter, both species migrate south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, where they are virtually indistinguishable from one another.
In plumage, the Pacific-slope Flycatcher is virtually identical to the Cordilleran Flycatcher, and differs only subtly from most <i>Empidonax</i> flycatchers in North America, but its breeding habitat and call are different. Its call can vary slightly by different regions and the bird itself.
The Pacific-slope Flycatcher inhabits either coniferous or deciduous forests. In its range it enters <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_mixed_evergreen_forest" title="California mixed evergreen forest">mixed woods</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas-fir" title="Douglas-fir">douglas fir forests</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_Redwood" title="Coast Redwood" class="mw-redirect">redwood forests</a>, and many other wooded environments including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian_forest" title="Riparian forest">Riparian woodlands</a>.
As a flycatcher it will wait on a perch and when it sees a flying insect it will chase it without any apparent effort. They also enter swarms of gnats, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito" title="Mosquito">mosquitos</a> and wherever such insects congregate. They fulfill an important role in keeping insects, particularly mosquito's population in check.
