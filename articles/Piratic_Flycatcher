The <b>Piratic Flycatcher</b> (<i>Legatus leucophaius</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a>, the only member of the genus <i>Legatus</i>. It is a resident breeder from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>. At least some birds from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> and Trinidad are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, and this species also visits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobago" title="Tobago">Tobago</a>.
This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher" title="Tyrant flycatcher">tyrant flycatcher</a> is found in savannah and other semi-open habitat with large trees. It gets its name because it does not build its own nest, but appropriates the domed or enclosed nests of other, often far larger, bird species, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-rumped_Cacique" title="Yellow-rumped Cacique">Yellow-rumped Cacique</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crested_Oropendola" title="Crested Oropendola">Crested Oropendola</a>. Once the persistence of the flycatchers has driven the rightful owners away, their eggs are removed, and the female flycatcher lays up to four, but usually two, black-streaked brown eggs. She incubates these on her own for 16 days to hatching, with a further 18â€“20 days to fledging.
The adult Piratic Flycatcher is 15&nbsp;cm long and weighs 23g. The upperparts are unstreaked plain brown, although the flight feathers have narrow white edges. The head has a long whitish supercilium, a concealed yellow crown stripe, and a dusky mask through the eyes. The throat is white, and there is a white malar stripe. The underparts are whitish with touches of light yellow, besides blurred brownish streaking on the breast and flanks. The dark bill is short and broad.
The call is an upslurred <i>weeEEE</i> given from a high perch for long periods of the day, or sometimes a monotonous <i>weep weep weep</i>.
Piratic Flycatchers wait on an exposed perch high in a tree, occasionally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallying_out" title="Sallying out" class="mw-redirect">sallying out</a> to feed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a>, their staple diet. The young are fed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>.
