Its feet are feathered to the toes (hence its scientific name, <i>lagopus</i>, meaning "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare" title="Hare">hare-footed</a>") as an adaptation to its arctic home range. <i>Lagopus</i> is derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> <i>lago</i> (<i>λαγως</i>), meaning "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare" title="Hare">hare</a>", and <i>pous</i> (<i>πους</i>), meaning "foot".<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Its talons are relatively small, reflecting their preferred choice of prey.

There are at least 3 recognized subspecies of <i>Buteo lagopus</i>:
The Rough-legged Hawk breeds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiga" title="Taiga">taiga</a> habitats of North America and Eurasia between the latitudes of 61 and 76° N. Rough-legged Hawks occurring in North America migrate to the central United States for the winter, while Eurasian individuals migrate to southern Europe and Asia. It is the only member of its diverse genus found in both of the Northern continents and has a complete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarctic" title="Subarctic">circumpolar</a> distribution. During these winter months, from November to March, preferred habitats include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshes" title="Marshes" class="mw-redirect">marshes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairies" title="Prairies" class="mw-redirect">prairies</a> and agricultural regions where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent" title="Rodent">rodent</a> prey is most abundant.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_2-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Breeding sites are usually located in areas with plenty of unforested, open ground.<sup id="cite_ref-virtualwildlife_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-virtualwildlife-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Depending on snow conditions, migrants arrive at breeding grounds during April and May.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_2-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Home ranges vary with food supply but are commonly reported to be 10–15 km<sup>2</sup> (3.9–5.8 sq&nbsp;mi) during the winter, but little is known about home ranges during the breeding season.<sup id="cite_ref-virtualwildlife_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-virtualwildlife-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Although frequently attacked in skirmishes by other highly territorial birds such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrfalcons" title="Gyrfalcons" class="mw-redirect">gyrfalcons</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skuas" title="Skuas" class="mw-redirect">skuas</a>, the Rough-legged Buzzard is not strongly territorial.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_2-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species is carnivorous, typically feeding on small mammals, which make up 62–98% of its diet. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemming" title="Lemming">Lemmings</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voles" title="Voles" class="mw-redirect">voles</a> are the major prey items of this species, seasonally comprising up to 80–90% of their prey, but this varies with seasonal availability.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_2-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Condor_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Condor-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Some evidence suggests that these hawks may be able to see vole scent marks which are only visible in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> range, allowing them to cue in on prey.<sup id="cite_ref-AvianBio_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AvianBio-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The Rough-legged Hawk will also supplement its diet with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mice" title="Mice" class="mw-redirect">mice</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerbils" title="Gerbils" class="mw-redirect">gerbils</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikas" title="Pikas" class="mw-redirect">pikas</a> and insects.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_2-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Condor_14-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Condor-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Besides mammals, birds are the second most favored type of prey for Rough-legs. Most avian prey species are small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerines</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Bunting" title="Snow Bunting">Snow Buntings</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapland_Longspur" title="Lapland Longspur">Lapland Longspur</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Tree_Sparrow" title="American Tree Sparrow">American Tree Sparrow</a>. However, they will also prey on birds slightly larger than the passerines typically targeted, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagopus" title="Lagopus">ptarmigan</a>, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfowl" title="Waterfowl">waterfowl</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorebird" title="Shorebird" class="mw-redirect">shorebirds</a> (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruff" title="Ruff">Ruffs</a>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-eared_Owl" title="Short-eared Owl">Short-eared Owls</a>.

This avian predator hunts opportunistically, occasionally supplementing their diet with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion" title="Carrion">carrion</a>, but focusing primarily on the most locally abundant small vertebrates. Rough-legged Hawks will steal prey from other individuals of the same species as well as other species such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Hawk" title="Red-tailed Hawk">Red-tailed Hawk</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Harrier" title="Northern Harrier" class="mw-redirect">Northern Harrier</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Kestrel" title="American Kestrel">American Kestrel</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Raven" title="Common Raven">Common Raven</a>. Prey sizes typically range from 6.5–2,587 g (0.23–91.3 oz) and adults require 80–120 g (2.8–4.2 oz) of food daily.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_8-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> These raptors hunt during the daytime.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_8-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Like most <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteo" title="Buteo">Buteos</a></i>, Rough-legged Buzzards have been reported both still-hunting (watching for prey from a perch and then stooping) and watching for prey while in flight. Unlike other large raptors, they may engage in hovering flight above the ground while search for prey.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_2-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Sexual maturity is reached at about two years old. Breeding generally occurs during May but is variable depending upon dates of arrival at breeding grounds. The Rough-legged Hawk is thought to be monogamous, mating with a single individual for multiple years.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_2-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> No evidence currently suggest otherwise.
Nests are built soon after arrival to breeding grounds and require 3–4 weeks to complete. Twigs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedges" title="Sedges" class="mw-redirect">sedges</a> and old feathers are used as building materials. Nests are 60–90 cm (24–35 in) in diameter and 25–60 cm (9.8–24 in) in height.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_2-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Cliff ledges and rocky outcroppings are preferred nesting sites. Females can lay 1–7 eggs but will typically lay 3–5.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_2-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-virtualwildlife_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-virtualwildlife-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Average egg size is 56.4&nbsp;mm (2.22&nbsp;in) in length by 44.7&nbsp;mm (1.76&nbsp;in) in width. Minimum incubation period is 31 days, provided almost exclusively by the female. The male feeds the female during this incubation period. After hatching, young require 4–6 weeks before fledging the nest. Fledglings depend on parents to provide food for 2–4 weeks after leaving the nest.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_2-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Rough-legged Buzzards that survive to adulthood can live to an age of 19 years in the wild. One female being kept in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho" title="Idaho">Idaho</a> zoo is over 25 years of age. However, perhaps a majority of individuals in the wild do not survive past their first two years of life. The threats faced by young Rough-legs can include starvation when prey is not numerous, freezing when Northern climes are particularly harsh during brooding, destruction by humans, and predation by various animals. The chances of survival increase incrementally both when they reach the fledging stage and when they can start hunting for themselves. Death of flying immatures and adults are often the result of human activity, including collisions with powerlines, buildings and vehicles, incidental ingestion of poison or lead from prey or illegal hunting and trapping.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
Most predation recorded on this species is on the young at the nest. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_fox" title="Arctic fox">Arctic foxes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" title="Brown bear">brown bears</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine" title="Wolverine">wolverines</a> have all eaten eggs and young of this species if they are capable of accessing nests on foot. Avian scavengers, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven" title="Raven">ravens</a>, will also readily predate nests. Adults, being a large raptorial bird, have fewer natural predators but may die in conflicts, especially if they are defending their own nests and are occasionally predated by other large raptorial birds. Raptors who prey on Rough-legged Buzzards of most ages may include numerous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle" title="Eagle">eagles</a> as well as large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon" title="Falcon">falcons</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Eagle_Owl" title="Eurasian Eagle Owl" class="mw-redirect">Eurasian Eagle Owls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Horned_Owl" title="Great Horned Owl">Great Horned Owls</a> and other large <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteo" title="Buteo">Buteo</a></i> hawks, including those of their own species.<sup id="cite_ref-ADW_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ADW-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
Adult Rough-legged Hawks will vocalize alarm calls when intruders approach a nesting site. It is described as a downward slurring whistle, sounding like <i>kiu wiyuk</i> or a lengthy descending <i>kee-eer</i> similar to that of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Hawk" title="Red-tailed Hawk">Red-tailed Hawk</a>. This cry is given in flight or from a perch every 15–30 s. During courtship, both sexes have been recorded to give a whistling sound that changes to a hiss. Following copulation, females will give a clucklike sound and males vocalize a whistling noise. Fledglings will give begging calls while waiting for parents to provide food.<sup id="cite_ref-BNA_2-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BNA-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
