The <b>Abert's Towhee</b> (<i>Melozone aberti</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> of the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emberizidae" title="Emberizidae">Emberizidae</a>, native to a small range in southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, generally the lower <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River" title="Colorado River">Colorado River</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gila_River" title="Gila River">Gila River</a> watersheds, nearly endemic to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>, but also present in small parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora" title="Sonora">Sonora</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.
This bird is common in brushy riparian habitats in the Lower <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoran_Desert" title="Sonoran Desert">Sonoran desert</a> zone but may require some effort to see as it prefers to stay well-hidden under bushes. Though threatened by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowbird" title="Cowbird">cowbird</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite" title="Brood parasite">nest parasitism</a> and habitat loss, it has successfully colonized suburban environments in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a> metropolitan area and may be fairly easily seen on the campus of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University" title="Arizona State University">Arizona State University</a>. Despite its limited range, it is classified as a species of least concern in the IUCN Redlist, and there has been some range expansion along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_River_(Arizona)" title="Santa Cruz River (Arizona)">Santa Cruz River</a> as well as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Creek_Canyon" title="Oak Creek Canyon">Oak Creek Canyon</a> near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona" title="Sedona" class="mw-redirect">Sedona</a>.
Abert's Towhees are recognized by their relatively long tails, dark faces, and overall brown plumage. They are related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_sparrow" title="American sparrow">sparrows</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junco" title="Junco">juncos</a> but are more similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrasher" title="Thrasher">thrashers</a> in appearance. They can be confused with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Towhee" title="California Towhee">California Towhees</a>, but their dark faces are distinct, and the range of these species only slightly overlaps. The Abert's Towhee is the longest species in the diverse <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emberizidae" title="Emberizidae">Emberizidae</a> at 21 to 25 cm (8.3 to 9.8 in) long, but its length is boasted by a relatively long tail, at 10 to 12 cm (3.9 to 4.7 in) in length.<sup id="cite_ref-Byers_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Byers-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Males weigh from 40–54.1 g (1.4–1.91 oz), with an average of 47.1&nbsp;g (1.66&nbsp;oz), while females weigh from 39.5–51 g (1.39–1.8 oz), with an average of 44.8&nbsp;g (1.58&nbsp;oz).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In terms of weight, it is outbulked by several other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towhee" title="Towhee">towhee</a> species.<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 8.2 to 9.7 cm (3.2 to 3.8 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 1.5 to 1.6 cm (0.59 to 0.63 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 2.6 to 2.9 cm (1.0 to 1.1 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Byers_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Byers-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
These birds are often seen foraging among dense brush for seeds. Like other towhees, they scratch at the ground in a manner similar to quail, and will sometimes dig up and eat grubs. They can be attracted to feeders by providing cracked corn on the ground.
The name of this bird commemorates the American ornithologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_William_Abert" title="James William Abert">James William Abert</a> (1820–1897).
