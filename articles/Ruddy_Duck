<i>Erismatura jamaicensis</i>
The <b>Ruddy Duck</b> (<i>Oxyura jamaicensis</i>) is a duck from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes_Mountains" title="Andes Mountains" class="mw-redirect">Andes Mountains</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff-tailed_duck" title="Stiff-tailed duck">stiff-tailed ducks</a>.
Their breeding habitat is marshy lakes and ponds. They nest in dense marsh vegetation near water. The female builds the nest out of grass, locating it in tall vegetation to hide it from predators. A typical brood contains 5 to 15 ducklings.<sup id="cite_ref-LPZRuddyDuck_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LPZRuddyDuck-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Pairs form each year.
Adult males have a rust-red body, a blue bill, and a white face with a black cap. Adult females have a grey-brown body with a greyish face with a darker bill, cap and a cheek stripe. The southern subspecies <i>ferruginea</i> is occasionally considered a distinct species. It is separable by its all-black face and larger size. The subspecies <i>andina</i> has a varying amount of black coloration on its white face; it may in fact be nothing more than a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybrid</a> population between the North American and the Andean Ruddy Duck. As the Colombian population is becoming scarce, it is necessary to clarify its taxonomic status, because it would be relevant for conservation purposes.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from January 2012">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> and winter in coastal bays and unfrozen lakes and ponds.
These birds dive and swim underwater. They mainly eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a> and roots of aquatic plants, aquatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>.
As a result of escapes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfowl" title="Wildfowl" class="mw-redirect">wildfowl</a> collections, they are now established in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, from where they have spread widely into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>.
