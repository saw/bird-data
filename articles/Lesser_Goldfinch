<i>Spinus psaltria</i><br />
<i>Astragalinus psaltria</i>
The <b>Lesser Goldfinch</b> or <b>Dark-backed Goldfinch</b> (<i>Carduelis psaltria</i>) is a very small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a>. Together with its relatives the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Goldfinch" title="American Goldfinch">American Goldfinch</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence%27s_Goldfinch" title="Lawrence's Goldfinch">Lawrence's Goldfinch</a>, it forms the American goldfinches <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade" title="Clade">clade</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carduelis" title="Carduelis">Carduelis</a> sensu stricto</i>.
The American goldfinches can be distinguished by the males having a black (rarely green) forehead, whereas the latter is (like the rest of the face) red or yellow in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Goldfinch" title="European Goldfinch">European Goldfinch</a> and its relatives. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> males are markedly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)" title="Polymorphism (biology)">polymorphic</a> and 5 subspecies are often named; at least 2 of them seem to represent a less-progressed stage in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolution</a> however.
This petite species is not only the smallest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> <i>Carduelis</i> finch, it may be the smallest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringillidae" title="Fringillidae" class="mw-redirect">true finch</a> in the world.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Some sources list more subtropical <i>Carduelis</i> species as slightly smaller on average, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_Siskin" title="Andean Siskin">Andean Siskin</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Clement_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Clement-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> This species ranges from 9 to 12 cm (3.5 to 4.7 in) in length and can weigh from 8 to 11.5 g (0.28 to 0.41 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-Clement_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Clement-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CRC_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 5.5 to 7 cm (2.2 to 2.8 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail" title="Tail">tail</a> is 3.9 to 4.7 cm (1.5 to 1.9 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 0.9 to 1.1 cm (0.35 to 0.43 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 1.1 to 1.2 cm (0.43 to 0.47 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Clement_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Clement-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> There is a slight NW-SE <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(population_genetics)" title="Cline (population genetics)" class="mw-redirect">cline</a> in size, with the largest birds from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and south being up to one-fifth larger than the smallest from the extreme NW of its range; this effect is more pronounced in females. There is also considerable variation in the amount of black on head and back in males, and thus three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> have been proposed. But this variation too seem to be simple and clinal changes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency" title="Allele frequency">allele frequency</a>, and thus the "subspecies" might be better considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)" title="Polymorphism (biology)">morphs</a> or geographical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_(zoology)" title="Form (zoology)">forms</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-willoughby2007_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-willoughby2007-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
Males are easily recognized by their bright yellow underparts and big white patches in the tail (outer rectrices) and on the wings (the base of the primaries). They range from having solid black from the back to the upper head including the ear-coverts to having these regions medium green; each of the back, crown and ear regions varies in darkness rather independently though as a rule the ears are not darker than the rest. In most of the range dark <i><b>psaltria</b></i> birds (<b>Arkansas Goldfinch</b>) predominate. The light birds are termed <i><b>hesperophilus</b></i> and are most common in the far western U.S. and northwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-willoughby2007_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-willoughby2007-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
The zone in which both light and dark males occur on a regular basis is broadest in the north, and extends across the width of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_Occidental" title="Sierra Madre Occidental">Sierra Madre Occidental</a> ranges. It reaches the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Pacific</a> coast in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora" title="Sonora">Sonora</a> to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinaloa" title="Sinaloa">Sinaloa</a>, roughly between area of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_Obreg%C3%B3n" title="Ciudad Obregón">Ciudad Obregón</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culiac%C3%A1n" title="Culiacán">Culiacán</a>.

Females' and immatures' upperparts are more or less grayish olive-green; their underparts are yellowish, buffier in immatures. They have only a narrow strip of white on the wings (with other white markings in some forms) and little or no white on the tail. They are best distinguished from other members of the genus by the combination of small size, upperparts without white or yellow, and dark gray bill. In all plumages this bird can easily be taken for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_warbler" title="New World warbler">New World warbler</a> if the typical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finch" title="Finch">finch</a> bill isn't seen well.
Like other goldfinches, it has an undulating flight in which it frequently gives a call: in this case, a harsh <i>chig chig chig</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Another distinctive call is a very high-pitched, drawn-out whistle, often rising from one level pitch to another (<i>teeeyeee</i>) or falling (<i>teeeyooo</i>). The song is a prolonged warble or twitter, more phrased that that of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Goldfinch" title="American Goldfinch">American Goldfinch</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> often incorporating imitations of other species.
This American goldfinch ranges from the southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> (near the coast, as far north as extreme southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)" title="Washington (state)">Washington</a>) to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a>. It <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrates</a> from the colder parts of its U.S. range.
The Lesser Goldfinch often occurs in flocks or at least loose associations. It utilizes almost any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a> with trees or shrubs except for dense forest, and is common and conspicuous in many areas, often coming near houses. It is common at feeders in the Southwest United States and will come almost anywhere with thistle sock feeders. Flocks of at least six birds will often be seen at feeders. It feeds mostly on tree buds and weed seeds; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophagy" title="Geophagy">geophagy</a> has been observed in this species.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
The nesting season is in summer in the temperate parts of its range; in the tropics it apparently breeds all-year round, perhaps less often in September/October.<sup id="cite_ref-cisneros-heredia_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cisneros-heredia-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> It lays three or four bluish white eggs in a cup nest made of fine plant materials such as lichens, rootlets, and strips of bark, placed in a bush or at low or middle levels in a tree.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moult" title="Moult" class="mw-redirect">moult</a> occurs in two different patterns which coincides with the blackness of the upperparts quite well. Here too is a broad zone of intergradation. Pacific birds moult after breeding, and females shed a few body feathers before breeding too. Juvenile males shed more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remiges" title="Remiges" class="mw-redirect">remiges</a> than females when moulting into adult plumage. East of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/106th_meridian_west" title="106th meridian west">106th meridian west</a>, birds moult strongly before breeding and replace another quantity of feathers afterwards, and postjuvenal moult does not differ significantly between the sexes. However, this seems dependent on the differing rainfall regimes; simply put, birds at least anywhere in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> range moult most of their plumage at the end of the dry season and may replace more feathers at the end of the wet season.<sup id="cite_ref-willoughby2007_7-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-willoughby2007-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
Considered a Species of Least Concern by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a> due to its vast range, it nonetheless seems to be declining locally. For example, it is rare in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuadorean</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a> foothills.<sup id="cite_ref-cisneros-heredia_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cisneros-heredia-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
