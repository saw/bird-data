The archipelago of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores" title="Azores">Azores</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, takes its name from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese language</a> word for goshawk, (<i>açor</i>), because the explorers who discovered the archipelago thought the birds of prey they saw there were goshawks; later it was found that these birds were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milvus" title="Milvus">kites</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Buzzard" title="Common Buzzard">Common Buzzards</a> (<i>Buteo buteo rothschildi</i>).
The Northern Goshawk is the largest member of the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter" title="Accipiter">Accipiter</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> It is a raptor with short, broad wings and a long tail, both adaptations to manoeuvring through trees in the forests it lives and nests in. Across most of the species's range, it is blue-grey above and barred grey or white below, but Asian subspecies in particular range from nearly white overall to nearly black above. The juvenile is brown above and barred brown below. Juveniles and adults have a barred tail, with dark brown or black barring. Adults always have a white eye stripe. In North America, juveniles have pale-yellow eyes, and adults develop dark red eyes usually after their second year, although nutrition and genetics may affect eye color as well. In Europe and Asia, juveniles also have pale-yellow eyes, however adults develop orange-colored eyes.

Northern Goshawks can be found in both deciduous and coniferous forests. They seem to only thrive in areas with mature, old-growth woods and are typically found where human activity is relatively low. During nesting season, they favor tall trees with intermediate canopy coverage and small openings below for hunting. They can be found at almost any altitude, but are typically found at high elevations recently due to a paucity of extensive forests remaining in lowlands across much of its range. In winter months, the Northernmost populations move down to warmer forests with lower elevations, continuing to avoid detection except while migrating. A majority of goshawks around the world remain sedentary throughout the year.
This species hunts birds and mammals in a variety of woodland habitats, often utilizing a combination of speed and obstructing cover to ambush birds and mammals. Goshawks are often seen flying along adjoining habitat types, such as the edge of a forest and meadow; flying low and fast hoping to surprise unsuspecting prey. They are usually opportunistic predators, as are most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">birds of prey</a>. The most important prey species are small mammals and birds found in forest habitats, in North America, this is compromised largely by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grouse" title="Grouse">grouse</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Crow" title="American Crow">American Crow</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowshoe_hare" title="Snowshoe hare">snowshoe hare</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_squirrel" title="Red squirrel">red squirrel</a>. Compared to many smaller <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter" title="Accipiter">Accipiter</a></i> species, Northern Goshawks are less specialized as predators of birds, with up to 69% of their diet comprised by either birds or mammals depending on location.<sup id="cite_ref-Sora_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sora-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Prey species may be quite diverse, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbiformes" title="Columbiformes" class="mw-redirect">pigeons and doves</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheasant" title="Pheasant">pheasants</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partridge" title="Partridge">partridges</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grouse" title="Grouse">grouse</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gulls</a>, assorted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader" title="Wader">waders</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpeckers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvid" title="Corvid" class="mw-redirect">corvids</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfowl" title="Waterfowl">waterfowl</a> (mostly tree-nesting varieties such as the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aythya" title="Aythya">Aythya</a></i> genus<sup id="cite_ref-Sora_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sora-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>) and various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerines" title="Passerines" class="mw-redirect">passerines</a> depending on the region.

Northern goshawks sometimes cache prey on tree branches or wedged in a crotch between branches for up to 32 hours. This is done primarily during the nestling stage.
In the spring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeding_season" title="Breeding season">breeding season</a>, Northern Goshawks perform a spectacular "undulating flight display", and this is one of the best times to see this secretive forest bird. At this time, the surprisingly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gull</a>-like call of this bird is sometimes heard. Adults defend their territories fiercely from intruders, including passing humans. It is presumed that their unusually aggressive nest defense is an adaptation to tree-climbing bears species, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Black_Bear" title="American Black Bear" class="mw-redirect">black bear</a> in North America. Additional predators at the nest may include formidable species such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher" title="Fisher">fishers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolves" title="Wolves" class="mw-redirect">wolves</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle" title="Eagle">eagles</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Horned_Owl" title="Great Horned Owl">Great Horned</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Eagle_Owl" title="Eurasian Eagle Owl" class="mw-redirect">Eurasian Eagle Owls</a>. Goshawks are most under threat from hatching until their fledgling stage, and are rarely threatened outside their own species once they attain adulthood. Other raptor species are attacked at nest sites, over competition for food and in territorial behavior and many are regularly displaced or even killed by the aggressive goshawk.<sup id="cite_ref-RaptorsWorld_4-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RaptorsWorld-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The Northern Goshawk is considered a secretive raptor, and is rarely observed even in areas where nesting sites are common.
Adults return to their nesting territories by March or April and begin laying eggs in April or May. Territories often encompass a variety of habitats, however the immediate nest area is often found in a mature or old-growth forest. The clutch size is usually 2 to 4, but anywhere from 1 to 5 eggs may be laid. The female is the primary incubator, although the male will sometimes take a shift to give the female a chance to eat. The male does most of the hunting for both the female and the young at the nest. The eggs average 59&nbsp;mm ×&nbsp;45&nbsp;mm (2.3&nbsp;in ×&nbsp;1.8&nbsp;in) and weigh about 60&nbsp;g (2.1&nbsp;oz). The incubation period can range from 28 to 38 days. The young leave the nest after about 35 days and start trying to fly another 10 days later. The young may remain in their parents' territory for up to a year of age, at which point sexual maturity is reached.

In North America, several non-governmental conservation organizations petitioned the Department of Interior, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fish_%26_Wildlife_Service" title="United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service" class="mw-redirect">United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service</a> (1991 &amp; 1997) to list the Goshawk as "threatened" or "endangered" under the authority of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act" title="Endangered Species Act">Endangered Species Act</a>. Both petitions argued for listing primarily on the basis of historic and ongoing nesting habitat loss, specifically the loss of old-growth and mature forest stands throughout the goshawk's known range. In both petitions, the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service concluded that listing was not warranted, but state and federal natural resource agencies responded during the petition process with standardized and long-term goshawk inventory and monitoring efforts, especially throughout U.S. Forest Service lands in the Western U.S. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service" title="United States Forest Service">United States Forest Service</a> (US Dept of Agriculture) has listed the goshawk as a "sensitive species", while it also benefits from various protection at the state level.

Goshawk hunting flights in falconry typically begin from the falconer's gloved hand, where the fleeing bird or rabbit is pursued in a horizontal chase.
