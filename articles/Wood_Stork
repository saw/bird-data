The <b>Wood Stork</b> (<i>Mycteria americana</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">American</a> wading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciconiiformes" title="Ciconiiformes">stork</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> Ciconiidae. It was formerly called the <b>"Wood Ibis"</b>, though it is not really an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibis" title="Ibis">ibis</a>.
The adult is a large bird which stands 83–115&nbsp;cm (33–45&nbsp;in) tall and spans 140–180&nbsp;cm (58–71&nbsp;in) across the wings. Males typically weigh 2.5–3.3&nbsp;kg (5.5-7.3&nbsp;lbs); females weigh 2.0–2.8&nbsp;kg (4.4-6.2&nbsp;lbs),<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> although large males can weigh up to 4.5&nbsp;kg (10&nbsp;lbs).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> It appears all white on the ground, with blackish-gray legs and pink feet. In flight, the trailing edge of the wings is black. The head is dark brown with a bald, black face, and the thick downcurved bill is dusky yellow. Juvenile birds are a duller version of the adult, generally browner on the neck, and with a paler bill. The bare head and the long bill, which can measure up to 25.5&nbsp;cm (10.0&nbsp;in) in length, render the Wood Stork distinctive from other large waders in its range.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The standard scientific measurements of the Wood stork are as follows: the wing is 42–49 cm (17–19 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmen_(bird)" title="Culmen (bird)" class="mw-redirect">culmen</a> is 19–25 cm (7.5–9.8 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 17.5–21.5 cm (6.9–8.5 in).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Wood Stork is a broad-winged soaring bird that flies with its neck outstretched and legs extended. It forages usually where lowering water levels concentrate fish in open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland" title="Wetland">wetlands</a>; it also frequents <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_field" title="Paddy field">paddy fields</a>. Walking slowly and steadily in shallow water up to its belly, it seeks prey, which, like that of most of its relatives, consists of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a> and large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>. It catches fish by holding its bill open in the water until a fish is detected.<sup id="cite_ref-sibley2003p58_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sibley2003p58-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
In the United States, the Wood Stork favors <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxodium" title="Taxodium">cypress</a> trees in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a>, swamps, or (less often) among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove" title="Mangrove">mangroves</a> and nearby habitat.<sup id="cite_ref-EDW18_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-EDW18-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The Wood Stork's endangered status resulted in the salvation of the small rural town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colquitt,_Georgia" title="Colquitt, Georgia">Colquitt, Georgia</a>. When the Department of Transportation was planning the construction of Highway 27, they intended to bypass the small community. The plans included a new bridge over Spring Creek and the swampy areas surrounding Colquitt. However, the residence of the Wood Stork in the swampy woodlands of Southwest Georgia required that the DOT use the existing bridge in Colquitt. Had the new bridge been built and the town bypassed, the town's economy would be little of what it is today. Colquitt is the home of Georgia's Folk Life Play, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_Gravy" title="Swamp Gravy">Swamp Gravy</a>, a theatrical production which brings in audience members from across the country. The old movie theater on the town square is currently being renovated to be a conference and concert hall, named The Woodstork Center.
A resident breeder in lowland wetlands with trees, the Wood Stork builds a large stick nest in a forest tree. They nest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_colony" title="Bird colony">colonially</a> with up to twenty-five nests in one tree.<sup id="cite_ref-EDW18_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-EDW18-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Breeding once a year, a female lays 3-5 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> in the typical clutch. The eggs are incubated 27–32 days by both sexes. Wood Storks' reproductive cycle is triggered when waterholes dry up sufficiently to concentrate fish in sufficient numbers for efficient feeding of the chicks. Each chick weighs approximately 2 ounces (60&nbsp;grams), is unable to fly and is helpless. Competition for food is fierce, and if food is scarce, only the older chicks will survive. Week-old chicks are fed about 15 times per day, and they grow rapidly. By 14 days, each will weigh 10 times its hatching weight. At 28 days, each is 25 times heavier. During the breeding season, Wood Storks need over 400 pounds (180&nbsp;kg) of fish to feed themselves and their offspring. When the weather is very warm, parents also collect water and bring it to the nest to drool on and into the mouths of the chicks. By the time the young are 4 weeks old, both parents leave the nest to search for food, and this continues until the chicks “fledge” or leave the nest. Young may continue to return to the colony for another 10 to 15 days to roost or to try to get food from their parents. A colony is considered successful if its parents average at least 1.5 fledged young per nest.<sup id="cite_ref-jaxzoo.org_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-jaxzoo.org-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
