The adult may feign injury to distract an intruder from the eggs or young birds.
They catch flying insects on the wing, making forays to catch its prey from the ground or a perch from a bush, tree, or large rock. They are mainly active at night, but can also be awake at dawn or dusk. They usually rest on the ground during the day.
