This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher" title="Tyrant flycatcher">tyrant flycatcher</a> is found in tall trees and shrubs, including the edges of savanna and marshes.

The adult Gray Kingbird is an average-sized kingbird. It measures 23&nbsp;cm (9.1&nbsp;in) in length and weighs from 37 to 52 g (1.3 to 1.8 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The upperparts are grey, with brownish wings and tail, and the underparts are white with a grey tinge to the chest. The head has a concealed yellow crown stripe, and a dusky mask through the eyes. The dark bill is heavier than that of the related, slightly smaller, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Kingbird" title="Tropical Kingbird">Tropical Kingbird</a>. The sexes are similar, but young birds have rufous edges on the wing coverts, rump and tail.
The call is a loud rolling trill, <i>pipiri pipiri</i>, which is the reason behind many of its local names, like <i>pestigre</i> or <i>pitirre</i>, in the Spanish-speaking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Antilles" title="Greater Antilles">Greater Antilles</a>, or "petchary" in some of the English-speaking zones.
Gray Kingbirds wait on an exposed perch high in a tree, occasionally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_(birds)" title="Hawking (birds)">sallying out</a> to feed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, their staple diet.
Like other kingbirds, these birds aggressively defend their territory against intruders, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a> and much larger birds such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracara" title="Caracara">caracaras</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-Tailed_Hawk" title="Red-Tailed Hawk" class="mw-redirect">Red-Tailed Hawks</a>. This phenomenon has led to the widespread adoption of the <i>pitirre</i> as a nationalist symbol (a sort of David vs. Goliath figure) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_independence_movement" title="Puerto Rican independence movement" class="mw-redirect">Puerto Rican independence movement</a>.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2009">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
It is found in increasing numbers in the state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>, and is more often found inland though it had been previously restricted to the coast.
