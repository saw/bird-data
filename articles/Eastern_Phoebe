The <b>Eastern Phoebe</b> (<i>Sayornis phoebe</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a>. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher" title="Tyrant flycatcher">tyrant flycatcher</a> breeds in eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, although its normal range does not include the southeastern coastal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">USA</a>.
It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering in the southernmost USA and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>. It is a very rare vagrant to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. This is one of the first birds to return to the breeding grounds in spring and one of the last to leave in the fall. They arrive for breeding in mid-late March, but they return to winter quarters around the same time when other migrant songbirds do, in September and early October; migration times have stayed the same in the last 100 years.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species appears remarkably big-headed, especially if it puffs up the small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(feathers)" title="Crest (feathers)">crest</a>. Its plumage is gray-brown above. It has a white throat, dirty gray breast and buffish underparts which become whiter during the breeding season. Two indistinct buff bars are present on each wing. Its lack of an eye ring and wingbars, and its all dark bill distinguish it from other North American tyrant flycatchers, and it pumps its tail up and down like other phoebes when perching on a branch. The Eastern Phoebe's call is a sharp <i>chip</i>, and the song, from which it gets its name, is <i>fee-bee</i>.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Wood_Pewee" title="Eastern Wood Pewee">Eastern Wood Pewee</a> (<i>Contopus virens</i>) is extremely similar in appearance and voice. It lacks the buff hue usually present on the lighter parts of the Eastern Phoebe's plumage, and thus has always clearly defined and contrasting wing-bars. It also does not bob its tail habitually, and appears on the breeding grounds much later though it leaves for winter quarters at about the same time as the Eastern Phoebe.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
The breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_(ecology)" title="Habitat (ecology)" class="mw-redirect">habitat</a> of the Eastern Phoebe is open woodland, farmland and suburbs, often near water. This phoebe is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivore" title="Insectivore">insectivorous</a>, and often perches conspicuously when seeking food items. It also eats <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry" title="Berry">berries</a> in cooler weather.
It often nests on human structures such as bridges and buildings. Nesting activity may start as early as the first days of April.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The nest is an open cup with a mud base and lined with moss and grass, built in crevice in a rock or man-made site; 3â€“8 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> are laid. Both parents feed the young and usually raise two broods per year. The Eastern Phoebe is occasionally host to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite" title="Brood parasite">nest-parasitic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-headed_Cowbird" title="Brown-headed Cowbird">Brown-headed Cowbird</a> (<i>Molothrus ater</i>).
