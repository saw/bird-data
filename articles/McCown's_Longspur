The <b>McCown's Longspur</b> (<i>Rhynchophanes mccownii</i>) is a small ground-feeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> from the family Calcariidae, which also contains the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longspur" title="Longspur">longspurs</a> and snow buntings.
These birds have a large cone-shaped bill, a streaked back, a rust-coloured shoulder and a white tail with a dark tip. In breeding plumage, the male has a white throat and underparts, a grey face and nape and a black crown. Other birds have pale underparts, a dark crown and may have some black on the breast. The male's song is a clear warble. The call is a dry rattle.
In winter, they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> in flocks to prairies and open fields in the southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. They prefer areas with sparser vegetation than those chosen by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut-collared_Longspur" title="Chestnut-collared Longspur">Chestnut-collared Longspur</a>. These birds forage on the ground, gathering in flocks outside of the nesting season. They sometimes make short flights in pursuit of flying insects. They mainly eat seeds, also eating insects in summer. Young birds are mainly fed insects. This bird breeds in dry short grass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie" title="Prairie">prairies</a> in central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Prairies" title="Canadian Prairies">Canadian Prairies</a>), and the north central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. The female lays 3 or 4 eggs in a grass cup nest in a shallow scrape on the ground. The male sings and flies up to defend his territory. Both parents feed the young birds.
The numbers and range of these birds have declined since the early 1900s due to habitat loss.
This bird was named after Captain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_P._McCown" title="John P. McCown">John P. McCown</a>, an American army officer.
