<i>Parus rufescens</i>
The <b>Chestnut-backed Chickadee</b> (<i><b>Poecile rufescens</b></i>, formerly <i>Parus rufescens</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_(bird)" title="Tit (bird)">tit</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a>, Paridae.
It is found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest" title="Pacific Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> to southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>. It is a permanent resident within its range, with some seasonal movements as feeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flock_(birds)" title="Flock (birds)">flocks</a> move short distances in search of food. They usually move to lower elevations in the same area upon onset of winter and move back up to higher elevations in late summer.
It is a small chickadee, 11.5–12.5&nbsp;cm (4.5"-4.9") long with a weight of 8.5–12.6 g. The head is dark blackish-brown with white cheeks, the mantle is bright rufous-brown, the wing feathers are dark gray with paler fringes. The underparts are white to pale grayish-white, with rufous or pale gray flanks. It is often considered the most handsome of all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickadee" title="Chickadee" class="mw-redirect">chickadees</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Sonoma_Audubon_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sonoma_Audubon-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> They often move through the forest in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-species_foraging_flock" title="Mixed-species foraging flock">mixed feeding flocks</a>, and are often seen in large groups with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bushtit" title="American Bushtit">Bushtits</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_warbler" title="New World warbler">warblers</a>.
There are three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>, with the flanks being grayer and less rufous further south (del Hoyo et al. 2007):
Its habitat is low elevation coniferous and mixed coniferous/deciduous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forests</a>. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area" title="San Francisco Bay Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a> this bird has readily adapted to suburban settings, prompting a range expansion. It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">cavity-nester</a>, usually utilizing an abandoned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> hole, but sometimes excavating on its own. Chestnut-backed chickadees use lots of fur and hair to make their nests. Their nests are actually 50% fur and hair. The most common hair they use comes from deer, rabbits, and coyotes. The adult chickadees also make a layer of fur about a centimeter thick which is used to cover the eggs on the nest whenever they leave the nest. It lays 5-8 (sometimes 9) eggs per clutch.
Its food is largely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and other invertebrates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleaning_(birds)" title="Gleaning (birds)">gleaned</a> from foliage. Chestnut-backed Chickadees take some seeds, especially those of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">conifers</a>, and fruit. It will visit bird feeders, including hummingbird feeders, and especially loves <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suet" title="Suet">suet</a>.
Often, it is still placed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i>Parus</i> with most other tits, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MtDNA" title="MtDNA" class="mw-redirect">mtDNA</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_b" title="Cytochrome b">cytochrome <i>b</i></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequence" title="DNA sequence" class="mw-redirect">sequence</a> data and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphology</a> suggest that separating <i>Poecile</i> more adequately expresses these birds' relationships (Gill <i>et al.</i>, 2005). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> has been treating <i>Poecile</i> as a distinct genus for some time already.
