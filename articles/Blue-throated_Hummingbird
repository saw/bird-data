The <b>Blue-throated Mountaingem</b>, also known as the <b>Blue-throated Mountain-gem</b> or <b>Blue-throated Hummingbird</b> (<i>Lampornis clemenciae</i>) is a species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird" title="Hummingbird">hummingbird</a>, a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochilidae" title="Trochilidae" class="mw-redirect">Trochilidae</a> family of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a>.
The Blue-throated Mountaingem is a fairly large hummingbird, reaching 11.5 to 12.5&nbsp;cm (4Â½ to 5 inches) in length and 6 to 10 grams in weight. The Blue-throated Hummingbird is dull green on the top of its body, fading to medium gray on its belly. It has a conspicuous white stripe behind its eye and a narrower stripe extending backward from the corner of its bill, bordering a blackish cheek patch. Its tail feathers are iridescent blue-black with broad white tips on the outer two to three pairs. The species gets its name from the adult male's iridescent blue throat patch (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorget_(birds)" title="Gorget (birds)" class="mw-redirect">gorget</a>), but the female lacks this, having a plain gray throat. Males sing two types of songs: a simple "peep song," which sounds like a squeaky wheel, and a quiet but complex "whisper song." The female is also reported to sing during the breeding season to attract the attention of males.
The Blue-throated Mountaingem is native to mountain woodlands of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, although during the summer it is an uncommon to rare resident of moist, wooded canyons in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrean_sky_islands" title="Madrean sky islands" class="mw-redirect">Madrean sky islands</a> of southeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>, southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>, and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and northeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora" title="Sonora">Sonora</a>, Mexico. A few individuals traditionally winter at feeding stations in southeastern Arizona.
The male takes no part in nest building or care of the young. The female constructs her nest from soft plant fibers, held together and attached to its support (a tree branch, flowering plant, fern, vine, rock shelf, or manmade object such as a wire or nail) using strands of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_silk" title="Spider silk">spider silk</a> stolen from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_web" title="Spider web">spider webs</a>. The exterior is camouflaged with green <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss" title="Moss">mosses</a> where available; in drier habitats, mosslike dendroid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichens" title="Lichens" class="mw-redirect">lichens</a> may be used, or the exterior may be left bare. Blue-throated Hummingbirds frequently nest over water, especially flowing streams. The two white eggs hatch in 17 to 19 days, and the young leave the nest at 24 to 26 days of age. Up to three broods per year are possible under ideal conditions; the female usually builds each new nest atop the previous nest, leading to nest "towers" at traditional nest sites.
Like other hummingbirds, the Blue-throated Mountaingem feeds on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectar" title="Nectar">nectar</a> from flowers and catches <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_(birds)" title="Hawking (birds)">flight</a> and by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleaning_(birds)" title="Gleaning (birds)">gleaning</a> from vegetation. In winter, sap from wells drilled by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapsucker" title="Sapsucker">sapsuckers</a> may substitute for nectar.
