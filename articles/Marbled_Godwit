They nest on the ground, usually in short grass.
In autumn, they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> in flocks to the coasts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>.
These birds forage by probing on mudflats, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a>, or at the beach (see picture below). In short <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass" title="Grass">grass</a>, they may pick up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> by sight. They mainly eat insects and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>, but also eat parts of aquatic plants.
Their numbers were reduced by hunting at the end of the 19th century. Although they had recovered somewhat since that time, their population has declined in recent times as suitable habitat is used for farming.
