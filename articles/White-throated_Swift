Reaching a length of 16.5&nbsp;cm (6.5&nbsp;inches), with a wingspan of 35.5&nbsp;cm (14&nbsp;inches), the White-throated Swift is distinguished from other North American swifts by the whitish throat patch, which extends down to the belly. The upperparts, belly, and sides of the breast are black, and the underwings are gray.
Like all swifts, White-throated Swifts use their short legs only for clinging onto vertical surfaces or wires, and never land on the ground voluntarily.
