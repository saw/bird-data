It is a species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_warbler" title="New World warbler">New World warbler</a>.
Mature Hermit Warblers normally grow to be 4Â½ to 5&nbsp;inches long. Hermit Warblers are dark gray in coloration on top, and white below, and their flanks are streaked with black. The wings have two diagonal white wing bars. The majority of the Hermit Warbler's head is yellow, and males have a dark black throat, while females have much less black on their throat bib and immature birds have no black throat.
Hermit Warblers are common, but incredibly shy, birds that dwell in open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coniferous" title="Coniferous" class="mw-redirect">coniferous</a> forests. Their summer breeding range is the majority of the west coast of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(U.S._state)" title="Washington (U.S. state)" class="mw-redirect">Washington</a>. They will sometimes winter in south-west <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, but they are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> and will winter in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a>.
Nests are neat and cup-shaped, constructed from stems, grass, twigs, and pine needles positioned near the tip of a branch high in a conifer tree. The female will lay between 3 to 5 eggs, which are white in color and heavily spotted with brown and lilac speckles. Other incubation and nesting habits are mostly unknown.
Like most warblers the Hermit Warbler eats a strict diet of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a>, and can often be found hanging upside-down from the ends of conifer branches, like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titmouse" title="Titmouse" class="mw-redirect">chickadee</a>, probing for food.
