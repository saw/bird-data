The <b>Kelp Gull</b> (<i>Larus dominicanus</i>), also known as the <b>Dominican Gull</b>, breeds on coasts and islands through much of the southern hemisphere. The race <i>L. d. vetula</i> (known as the <b>Cape Gull</b>) occurs around southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, and nominate <i>L. d. dominicanus</i> is the subspecies found around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a> (where it overlaps with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Gull" title="Pacific Gull">Pacific Gull</a>), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> (where it is known as the <b>Southern Black-backed Gull</b> or by its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language" title="Māori language">Māori</a> name <b>Karoro</b>). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_name_(zoology)" title="Specific name (zoology)">specific name</a> comes from the Dominican order of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friar" title="Friar">friars</a> who wore black and white habits.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> This is a mainly coastal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gull</a>.
The nest is a shallow depression on the ground lined with vegetation and feathers. The female usually lays 2 or 3 eggs. Both parents feed the young birds.
The Kelp Gull superficially resembles two gulls from further north in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Black-backed_Gull" title="Lesser Black-backed Gull">Lesser Black-backed Gull</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Black-backed_Gull" title="Great Black-backed Gull">Great Black-backed Gull</a>. The Kelp is intermediate in size between these two species. This species ranges from 54 to 65 cm (21 to 26 in) in total length, from 128 to 142 cm (50 to 56 in) in wingspan and from 540 to 1,390 g (1.2 to 3.1 lb) in weight. Adult males and females weigh on average 1,000&nbsp;g (2.2&nbsp;lb) and 900&nbsp;g (2.0&nbsp;lb) respectively. Among standard measurements, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chord_(biology)" title="Wing chord (biology)">wing chord</a> is 37.3 to 44.8 cm (14.7 to 17.6 in), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> is 4.4 to 5.9 cm (1.7 to 2.3 in) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is 5.3 to 7.5 cm (2.1 to 3.0 in).<sup id="cite_ref-Olsen_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Olsen-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Harrison_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrison-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CRC_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The adult Kelp Gull has black upperparts and wings. The head, underparts, tail and the small "mirrors" at the wing tips are white. The bill is yellow with a red spot, and the legs are greenish-yellow (brighter and yellower when breeding, duller and greener when not breeding). The call is a strident <i>ki-och</i>. Juveniles have dull legs, a black bill, a dark band in the tail, and an overall grey-brown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> densely edged whitish, but they rapidly get a pale base to the bill and largely white head and underparts. They take three or four years to reach maturity.
The African subspecies <i>L. d. vetula</i> is sometimes split as the <b>Cape Gull</b>, <i>L. vetula</i>. It has a more angular head and a smaller shorter bill. The adult has a dark eye, whereas the nominate Kelp Gull usually has a pale eye. Young Cape Gulls have almost identical plumage to similarly aged Kelp Gulls.
Kelp Gulls are omnivores like most <i>Larus</i> gulls, and they will scavenge as well as seeking suitable small prey. It gathers on landfills and a sharp increase in its population is therefore considered as an indicator for a degraded environment.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Kelp Gulls have been observed feeding on live <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Right_Whale" title="Southern Right Whale" class="mw-redirect">right whales</a> since at least 1996.<sup id="cite_ref-whale_icb_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-whale_icb-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The Kelp Gull uses its powerful beak to peck down centimetres into the skin and blubber, often leaving the whales with large open sores, some of which have been observed to be half a meter in diameter. This predatory behavior has been continually documented in Argentinian waters, and continues today.<sup id="cite_ref-bbc_gull_whale_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bbc_gull_whale-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> At rocky sites along the southern African coast, such as at Boulders Beach in Cape Town, Kelp Gulls (<i>Larus dominicanus vetula</i>) can be seen picking up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellfish" title="Shellfish">shellfish</a> and repeatedly flying up several meters and dropping them onto the rocks below in order to break them open.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Cape Gull differs from other forms of Kelp Gulls by its immaculate white tail and dark eye.
