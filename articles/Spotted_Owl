The <b>Spotted Owl</b> (<i>Strix occidentalis</i>) is a species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_owl" title="True owl">true owl</a>. It is a resident species of old-growth forests in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, where it nests in tree holes, old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">bird of prey</a> nests, or rock crevices. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nests" title="Nests" class="mw-redirect">Nests</a> can be between 12 to 60 metres (39 to 200 ft) high and usually contain two eggs (though some will contain as many as four). It is a nocturnal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owl</a>, which feeds on small mammals and birds, which has only been discovered recently.
This owl has a length of 43&nbsp;cm (17&nbsp;inches), a wingspan of 114&nbsp;cm (45&nbsp;in), and a weight of around 600&nbsp;g (21&nbsp;oz). Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> are a little over 50&nbsp;mm (2.0&nbsp;in) long, and are white and smooth with a slightly grainy texture. The female sits on the eggs and cares for the young, while the male provides food for them. Juvenile Spotted Owls have an average survival rate of 11%, with an average birth rate of 0.58 owls per pair.
The Spotted Owl is similar in appearance to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_Owl" title="Barred Owl">Barred Owl</a> but has cross-shaped markings on the underparts, whereas the Barred Owl is alternately barred on the breast and streaked on the belly. Barred Owls are larger and grayer than Spotted Owls. In recent years the California and Northern subspecies of Spotted Owl have been displaced by Barred Owls, which are more aggressive, have a broader diet and occur in more varied habitats.<sup id="cite_ref-Welch2009_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Welch2009-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Though the two species may <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)">hybridize</a> in areas where displacement is occurring, they are quite genetically distinct, for example, differing 13.9% in certain gene sequences.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>

Several factors contribute to the Spotted Owl's variable reproductive success. For instance, Spotted Owl pairs do not breed every year.<sup id="cite_ref-r62_31-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r62-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Over a five-year period in western Oregon, the percentage of nesting Northern Spotted owls averaged 62% and ranged from 16% to 89%.<sup id="cite_ref-r62_31-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r62-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup>
Another source of the variation in reproductive output is Spotted Owl age. Spotted Owls are typically reproductive by three years of age.

Greater amounts of mature and old-growth forests have been associated with improved Northern Spotted Owl persistence and reproductive output in some areas.

The average number of fledglings per site was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in 990 acre (400 ha) areas of western Washington, western Oregon, and northwestern California with more than 60% mature (&gt;80 years) forest than in areas with 20% or less mature forest.<sup id="cite_ref-r19_40-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r19-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup>
In other locations the relationship between forest age and Northern Spotted Owl reproductive success has been ambiguous. In forests of the northern California Coast Ranges, greater reproductive success was negatively associated with clearcuts less than six years old at two scales, positively associated with 21- to 40-year-old forest at three scales, and negatively associated with 61- to 80-year-old forest at all five scales investigated.<sup id="cite_ref-r188_34-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-r188-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> In the eastern Cascade Range of Washington, the amount of late-successional forest (dominated by trees with &gt;25-inch (64&nbsp;cm) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter_at_breast_height" title="Diameter at breast height">diameter at breast height</a> (DBH)) within a 500 acre (200 ha) area of the nest was negatively associated with reproductive rate.
