The timing of Black Vultures' breeding season varies with the latitude at which they live. In the United States, birds in Florida begin breeding as early as January, for example, while those in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> generally do not start before March.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson_45-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-45"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> In South America, Argentinian and Chilean birds begin egg-laying as early as September, while those further north on the continent typically wait until October. Some in South America breed even later than that—Black Vultures in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> typically do not start until November, for example, and those in Ecuador may wait until February.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson_45-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-45"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> Pairs are formed following a courtship ritual which is performed on the ground: several males circle a female with their wings partially open as they strut and bob their heads.<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_27-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> They sometimes perform courtship flights, diving or chasing each other over their chosen nest site.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferguson_45-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferguson-45"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Black Vulture lays its eggs on the ground in a wooded area, a hollow log, or some other cavity, seldom more than 3 metres (9.8&nbsp;ft) above the ground.<sup id="cite_ref-Terres_27-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terres-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> While it generally does not use any nesting materials, it may decorate the area around the nest with bits of brightly colored plastic, shards of glass, or metal items such as bottle caps.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrison_35-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrison-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)" title="Clutch (eggs)">Clutch</a> size is generally two eggs, though this can vary from one to three. The egg is oval and on average measures 7.56 by 5.09&nbsp;centimeters (3 by 2&nbsp;in). The smooth, gray-green, bluish, or white shell is variably blotched or spotted with lavender or pale brown around the larger end.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrison_35-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrison-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> Both parents <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubate</a> the eggs, which hatch after 28 to 41 days.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrison_35-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrison-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> Upon hatching, the young are covered with white down.<sup id="cite_ref-Readers_40-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Readers-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> Both parents feed the nestlings, regurgitating food at the nest site. The young remain in the nest for two months, and after 75 to 80 days they are able to fly skillfully.<sup id="cite_ref-Fergus_37-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fergus-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> Predation of black vultures is relatively unlikely, though eggs and nestlings are readily eaten if found by mammalian predators such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon" title="Raccoon">raccoons</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coati" title="Coati">coatis</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox" title="Fox">foxes</a>. Due to its aggressiveness and size, few predators can threaten the fully-grown vulture. However, various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle" title="Eagle">eagles</a> may kill vultures in conflicts and even the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornate_Hawk-Eagle" title="Ornate Hawk-Eagle">Ornate Hawk-Eagle</a>, a slightly smaller bird than the vulture, have preyed on adult black vultures.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Black Vulture is considered a threat by cattle ranchers due to its predation on newborn cattle.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> The droppings produced by Black Vultures and other vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48"><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup> The bird is also considered a threat to the safety of aerial traffic, especially when it congregates in large numbers in the vicinity of garbage dumps<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49"><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup> — as is the case in the Rio de Janeiro <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Jobim_International_Airport" title="Tom Jobim International Airport" class="mw-redirect">Tom Jobim International Airport</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50"><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Black Vulture appears in a variety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_peoples" title="Maya peoples">Maya</a> hieroglyphics in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayan_codices" title="Mayan codices" class="mw-redirect">Mayan codices</a>.
