The <b>Aleutian Tern</b> (<i>Onychoprion aleuticus</i>, formerly <i>Sterna aleutica</i> - see Bridge <i>et al.</i>, 2005) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">tern</a> family Sternidae.
This species breeds in colonies on coasts and islands in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> and easternmost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>. It is strongly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>. Large numbers appear off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> during passage periods.
It is a very rare vagrant to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, with just one record, on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farne_Islands" title="Farne Islands">Farne Islands</a> off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumberland" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> on 28-29 May 1979.
It lays 2-3 eggs in a ground scrape. It sometimes nests among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Tern" title="Arctic Tern">Arctic Terns</a>, which, like most white terns, are fiercely defensive of their nest and young and will attack large predators.
Like most other terns, the Aleutian Tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, usually from saline environments. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.
This is a medium-sized tern, with a short, pointed bill and a long, deeply forked tail. It has a black cap with a white forehead, dark gray mantle and underparts and a mostly pale underwing with a dark secondary bar. It has a white rump and tail, black legs and a black bill.
The call is a musical <i>whee-hee-hee</i>.
