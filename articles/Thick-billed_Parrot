The Thick-billed Parrot is a medium-sized, up to 38&nbsp;cm&nbsp;(15&nbsp;in) long, bright green <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot" title="Parrot">parrot</a> with a large black bill and a red forecrown, shoulder and thighs. Adult eyes are amber, while juveniles have brown eyes. The rest of the bird is bright green. Thick-billed Parrots show red shoulders and leading edge on the underwing, followed by a blackish green stripe, then a yellow stripe, followed by the remaining underwing showing dark green. It appears to show a blackish tail.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Thick-billed Parrot lives in temperate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">conifer</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine" title="Pine">pine</a>, mature pine-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak" title="Oak">oak</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir" title="Fir">fir</a> forests from 1200 to 3600 meters. For the most part, it is restricted to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_Occidental" title="Sierra Madre Occidental">Sierra Madre Occidental</a> of Mexico, though it was formerly a rare visitor to the southwestern United States.
The Thick-billed Parrot likes to nest in tree cavities, especially old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> holes. It mainly feeds on seeds from various pine species, so much so their entire lives revolve around cone production. Flocks of these parrots roost by cliffs and they breed at the peak of pine seed production. It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad_(disambiguation)" title="Nomad (disambiguation)">nomadic</a>, following the variations of cone abundance. The bird sounds like a high pitched macaw and makes a variety of harsh, rolling calls. They are adept fliers.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction">Habitat destruction</a> and illegal bird trading gives the Thick-billed Parrot its endangered status on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List</a> of Threatened Species and listing on Appendix I of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES" title="CITES">CITES</a>. It is estimated that only 1000-4000 Thick-billed Parrots exist. However, this last living parrot species native to the United States is well-established in captive breeding programs in many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoos" title="Zoos" class="mw-redirect">zoos</a> across the world. Birds had been reintroduced in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> in the early 1980s, but this effort turned out to be unsuccessful. The parrots could not adapt to avoiding natural predators.
The re-introduction into the mountains of southeastern Arizona (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrean_sky_islands" title="Madrean sky islands" class="mw-redirect">Madrean sky islands</a> region), though well planned was dramatically impacted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator" class="mw-redirect">predation</a>. Due to extensive human development, residency, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, etc., high numbers of predator species exist, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawks" title="Hawks" class="mw-redirect">hawks</a>, and especially the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Goshawk" title="Northern Goshawk">goshawk</a>. The bird loss was especially high to these now well-emplaced predator species. A future attempt at introduction would have to include an ecosystem area that somehow limits the success of the numerous predator species.
For more than 10 years, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronatura_Noreste" title="Pronatura Noreste">Pronatura Noreste</a> (a northeastern Mexican environmental NGO) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterrey_Institute_of_Technology_and_Higher_Education" title="Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education">Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education</a> have been monitoring 700 nests of Thick-Billed Parrots in Chihuahua. Through conservation easements with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejido" title="Ejido">ejidos</a>, the organization has created sanctuaries for the protection of the bird's habitat.
