The <b>Golden-olive Woodpecker</b> (<i>Colaptes rubiginosus</i>) is a resident breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> south and east to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana" title="Guyana">Guyana</a>, northwest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobago" title="Tobago">Tobago</a>. It was formerly placed in the genus <i>Piculus</i> (Benz <i>et al.</i>, 2006). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_name" title="Scientific name" class="mw-redirect">scientific name</a> <i>rubiginosus</i> means "full of rust", describing the color of the bird's wings and back.
The habitat of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> is forests, more open woodland, and cultivation. It is most common in the mountains. Two or three white eggs are laid in a nest hole in a tree and incubated by both sexes. The young are fed by regurgitation.
The Golden-olive Woodpecker is 22&nbsp;cm long and weighs 68g. Adults are mainly golden olive above with some barring on the tail. The forecrown is grey, and the hindcrown red. The face is yellow-white and the underparts are barred black and yellowish. The bill is black. Adult males have a red moustachial strip which is lacking in the female.
Due to its habitat - mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montane_forest" title="Montane forest" class="mw-redirect">montane forest</a>, separated by large rivers - it has evolved into about 20 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>. <i>P. r. tobagensis</i> from Tobago is larger and heavier-billed than the Trinidadian <i>P. r. trinitatis</i>.
