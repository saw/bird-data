<i>Parus cinctus</i>
The <b>Grey-headed Chickadee</b> or <b>Siberian Tit</b> (<i><b>Poecile cinctus</b></i>, formerly <i>Parus cinctus</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> bird in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_(bird)" title="Tit (bird)">tit</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> Paridae. It is a widespread resident breeder throughout subarctic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and northern Asia, and also into North America in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> and the far northwest of Canada. It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">conifer</a> specialist. It is resident, and most birds do not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a>. Curiously (with respect to its name), the bird has no gray on its head, which is black, white, and brown.
It is a fairly large tit, 13.5–14 cm long with a weight of 11–14.3 g. The head is dark brown with white cheeks, the mantle brown, the wing feathers blackish with pale fringes, and the underpartswhitish with pale brown flanks.
Formerly, it was placed in the genus <i>Parus</i> with most other tits, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MtDNA" title="MtDNA" class="mw-redirect">mtDNA</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_b" title="Cytochrome b">cytochrome <i>b</i></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequence" title="DNA sequence" class="mw-redirect">sequence</a> data and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphology</a> suggest that separating <i>Poecile</i> more adequately expresses these birds' relationships (Gill <i>et al.</i>, 2005). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> has been treating <i>Poecile</i> as distinct genus for some time already. The genus name <i>Poecile</i> has often been treated as feminine (giving the species name ending <i>cincta</i>); however, this was not specified by the original genus author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Jakob_Kaup" title="Johann Jakob Kaup">Johann Jakob Kaup</a>, and under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature" title="International Code of Zoological Nomenclature">ICZN</a> the genus name must therefore be treated by default as masculine, giving the name ending <i>cinctus</i> (del Hoyo et al. 2007).
