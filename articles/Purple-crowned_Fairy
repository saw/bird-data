Its breeding habitat is forest canopy and edges at altitudes up to 1675m, and this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> can also be found in tall second growth and shady gardens . The female lays two white eggs in a small conical cup nest, which is made of plant down and sited near the tip of a thin branch.
The Purple-crowned Fairy is 11.5&nbsp;cm long and weighs 6.5 g. It is slender and has bright white underparts, a green back, and a long pointed tail which has black central and white outer feathers. There is a dark patch through the eye, and the bill is sharply pointed. The male has a purple crown and a purple spot at the end of the eyepatch, which is bordered below with a glittering green malar stripe.

The female lacks the purple and glittering green colours on the head, and the immature bird has rufous fringes to its upperpart plumage and a dusky throat.
