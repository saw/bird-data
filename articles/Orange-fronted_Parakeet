The <b>Orange-fronted Parakeet</b> or <b>Orange-fronted Conure</b> (<i>Aratinga canicularis</i>), also known as the <b>Half-moon Conure</b>, is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot" title="Parrot">parrot</a> which is a resident from western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>.
There are three subspecies:<sup id="cite_ref-zoonomen_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-zoonomen-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Orange-fronted Parakeets are 22.5&nbsp;cm long and weigh 80 g. The adult is mainly green, paler and yellower below and with an olive tone to the breast. The wings have blue outer primaries and yellow linings, and the pointed tail is tipped with blue. The head is distinctive, with a blue crown, orange forehead, bare yellow eye-ring, yellow iris and white bill. Young birds are similar to the adults, but with much less orange on the forehead.
It is found in lowlands and foothills on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Pacific</a> side of the central mountain ranges in forest canopy and edges, and more open woodland, including savanna and second growth.
The Orange-fronted Parakeet feeds in flocks which can reach 100 birds outside the breeding season, taking various seeds, flowers and fruits including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus" title="Ficus">figs</a>. Its flight call is a raucous <i>can-can-can</i>, and when perched it has a reedy <i>zeeweet</i>.
The 3-5 white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> are laid in an unlined nest cavity, usually self-excavated in an arboreal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite" title="Termite">termite</a> nest of the termite species <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasutitermes" title="Nasutitermes">Nasutitermes nigriceps</a></i>,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> but sometimes in an old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> hole or natural cavity.
The population has decreased in many areas due to persecution for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet" title="Pet">pet</a> trade.
