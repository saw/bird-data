<i>Charadrius hiaticula semipalmatus</i>
The <b>Semipalmated Plover</b> (<i>Charadrius semipalmatus</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plover" title="Plover">plover</a>.
This species weighs 22–63 g (0.78–2.2 oz) and measures 14–20 cm (5.5–7.9 in) in length and 35–56 cm (14–22 in) across the wings.<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Adults have a grey-brown back and wings, a white belly, and a white breast with one black neckband. They have a brown cap, a white forehead, a black mask around the eyes and a short orange and black bill.
Their breeding habitat is open ground on beaches or flats across northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>. They nest on the ground in an open area with little or no plant growth.
They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a> and winter in coastal areas ranging from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonia" title="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>. They are extremely rare vagrants to western Europe, although their true status may be obscured by the difficulty in identifying them from the very similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringed_Plover" title="Ringed Plover" class="mw-redirect">Ringed Plover</a> of Eurasia, of which it was formerly considered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>.
These birds forage for food on beaches, tidal flats and fields, usually by sight. They eat insects, crustaceans and worms.
This bird resembles the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killdeer" title="Killdeer">Killdeer</a> but is much smaller and has only one band.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The term "semipalmated" refers to its partly webbed feet. Like the Killdeer and since its nest is on the ground, it uses a "broken-wing" display to lure intruders away from the nest.
