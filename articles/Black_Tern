The <b>Black Tern</b> (<i>Chlidonias niger</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">tern</a> generally found in or near inland water in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. As its name suggests, it has predominantly dark plumage.
Adult are 25&nbsp;cm (9.75&nbsp;in) long, with a wing span 61&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in), and weigh 62 g (2.2&nbsp;oz). They have short dark legs and a short, weak-looking black bill, measuring 27â€“28&nbsp;mm, nearly as long as the head. The bill is long, slender, and looks slightly decurved. They have a dark grey back, with a white forewing, black head, neck (occasionally suffused with gray in the adult) and belly, black or blackish-brown cap (which unites in color with the ear coverts, forming an almost complete hood), and a light brownish-grey, 'square' tail. The face is white. There is a big dark triangular patch in front of the eye, and a broadish white collar in juveniles. There are grayish-brown smudges on the ides of the white breast, a downwards extension of the plumage of the upperparts. These marks vary in size and are not conspicuous. In non-breeding plumage, most of the black, apart from the cap, is replaced by grey. The plumage of the upperparts is drab, with pale feather-edgings. The rump is brownish-gray.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> race, <i>C. n. surinamensis</i>, is distinguishable from the European form in all plumages, and is considered by some to be a separate species.
In flight, the build appears slim. The wing-beats are full and dynamic, and flight is often erratic as it dives to the surface for food; similar to other tern species.
Hybridisation between this species and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-winged_Black_Tern" title="White-winged Black Tern" class="mw-redirect">White-winged Black Tern</a> has been recorded from Sweden<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> and the Netherlands.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Two juvenile birds at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chew_Valley_Lake" title="Chew Valley Lake">Chew Valley Lake</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, in September 1978 and September 1981, were also believed to be hybrids; they showed mixed characters of the two species, specifically a combination of a dark mantle (a feature of White-winged Black) with dark patches on the breast-side (a feature of Black Tern, not shown by White-winted Black).<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Their breeding habitat is freshwater marshes across most of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, the northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and much of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. They usually nest either on floating material in a marsh or on the ground very close to water, laying 2-4 eggs.

Unlike the "white" <i>Sterna</i> terns, these birds do not dive for fish, but forage on the wing picking up items at or near the water's surface or catching insects in flight. They mainly eat insects and fish as well as amphibians.
The American race has occurred as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrancy_in_birds" title="Vagrancy in birds" class="mw-redirect">vagrant</a> in Britain<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> and in Ireland.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
The North American population has declined in recent times due to loss of habitat.
