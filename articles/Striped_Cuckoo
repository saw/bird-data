The <b>Striped Cuckoo</b> (<i>Tapera naevia</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-passerine" title="Near-passerine" class="mw-redirect">near-passerine</a> bird, the only member of the genus <i>Tapera</i>. This resident <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo" title="Cuckoo">cuckoo</a> is found from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>.
The Striped Cuckoo is found in open country with trees or shrubs, and the edges of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove" title="Mangrove">mangrove</a> forests. It is among the very few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasitic" title="Brood parasitic" class="mw-redirect">brood parasitic</a> cuckoos of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a> (only other are <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromococcyx" title="Dromococcyx">Dromococcyx</a></i>), and typical hosts are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovenbird_(family)" title="Ovenbird (family)">spinetails</a>, but often also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wren" title="Wren">wrens</a>, and other species with domed nests. The female cuckoo lays one, sometimes two, white or bluish eggs in the host’s large stick nest. The eggs hatch in 15 days, with a further 18 days until the cuckoo fledges. The young spinetails disappear.
This species is about 27 centimetres (11&nbsp;in) long and weighs 40 grams (1.4&nbsp;oz). The adult is mainly grey-brown above, streaked with black and buff. It has a pale supercilium and a chestnut and black crest which is raised as part of its display. The underparts are off-white, and the tail is long and graduated. Immature birds are spotted with buff and are more rufous on the back and wings.
The Striped Cuckoo eats large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, often taken off the ground. This is a solitary and fairly shy species which tends to keep to the cover of bushes, although it will sing from more open perches. It has a whistled call usually of two or three notes, <i>wu-weee</i> or <i>wu-wu-wee</i>, and can be attracted by imitations of this.
