The <b>Laughing Falcon</b> (<i>Herpetotheres cachinnans</i>), also called the <b>Snake Hawk</b> (erroneously, since it is not a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawk</a>), is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">bird of prey</a> in the falcon family (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconidae" title="Falconidae">Falconidae</a>), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic_taxon" title="Monotypic taxon">only member</a> of the genus <i><b>Herpetotheres</b></i>.

Its common and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_name" title="Scientific name" class="mw-redirect">scientific names</a> both refer to its distinctive voice.
Its English name comes from its loud voice, as does the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_name_(zoology)" title="Specific name (zoology)">specific name</a> <i>cachinnans</i>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> for "laughing aloud" or "laughing immoderately".<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_a_biological_genus" title="Name of a biological genus" class="mw-redirect">generic name</a> <i>Herpetotheres</i> refers to its preferred food; it is Latinized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a>, derived from <i>[h]erpeton</i> (ἑρπετόν, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile" title="Reptile">reptile</a>") + <i>therizein</i> (θερίζειν, "to mow down").<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Its relationships with other members of the Falconidae are unclear. Traditionally it has been placed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfamily" title="Subfamily" class="mw-redirect">subfamily</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyborinae" title="Polyborinae" class="mw-redirect">Polyborinae</a> with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracara" title="Caracara">caracaras</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_falcon" title="Forest falcon">forest falcons</a>, but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a>'s North American Check-list Committee now places it in the same subfamily as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconinae" title="Falconinae" class="mw-redirect">true falcons</a>, while the South American Check-list Committee places it with the forest falcons but not the caracaras,<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> and it has also been considered a subfamily of its own.<sup id="cite_ref-chct1996_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-chct1996-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Laughing Falcon is 46 to 56 cm (18 to 22 in) long<sup id="cite_ref-jj2003_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-jj2003-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> and has a wingspan of 79 to 94 cm (31 to 37 in).<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> As usual among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_prey" title="Birds of prey" class="mw-redirect">birds of prey</a>, the females are bigger, weighing 600 to 800 g (1.3 to 1.8 lb) compared to the males' 410 to 680 g (0.90 to 1.5 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-jj2003_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-jj2003-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
Adults have a pale buff head, changeable between a more brownish and an almost white hue according to feather wear and individual variation. The broad black face mask stretches across the neck as a narrow collar, bordered with white. On the crown, the feather shafts are dark, producing a somewhat streaked effect. The upper wings and back are blackish brown. The uppertail coverts are whitish buff again, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectrice" title="Rectrice" class="mw-redirect">rectrices</a> are barred black and whitish, ending in white. The underside is uniformly pale buff; there may be a bit of dark speckling on the thighs, however. The underside of the wing is pale rufous-buff, sometimes with some dark spotting on the underwing coverts. The tips of the primary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remiges" title="Remiges" class="mw-redirect">remiges</a> are barred with pale grey below, their bases are quite rufous. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" title="Iris (anatomy)">iris</a> is dark brown, the bill is black with a pale yellow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cere" title="Cere" class="mw-redirect">cere</a>; the feet are also pale yellow.<sup id="cite_ref-chct1996_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-chct1996-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
Immature birds differ little from adults; they have lighter margins to the back feathers, producing a scalloped effect. The light parts of the plumage are almost white, paler than in adults; the unfeathered parts are also paler. Nestlings are covered in peculiarly dense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_feather" title="Down feather">down</a>, reminiscent of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duckling" title="Duckling" class="mw-redirect">duckling</a>'s; they are generally brownish buff, darker above, and already show the blackish facial marks of the adults.<sup id="cite_ref-chct1996_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-chct1996-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
With its big white (immature) or pale buff (adult) head having a dark brown mask from the eyes around to the nape, it is unmistakable.<sup id="cite_ref-chct1996_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-chct1996-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> In flight it shows a rufous patch near each wingtip (formed by the basal parts of the primaries) and a shape more like an <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter" title="Accipiter">Accipiter</a></i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawk</a> than most of its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon" title="Falcon">falcon</a> relatives, with short, rounded wings and a long tail.
The namesake call is a long series of separate, rather human-like cries, each one often rising sharply in pitch in the middle and sometimes falling sharply at the very end, changing from a "joyful" to a "sad" sound, and rendered as <i>ha-ha-ha har-her-her</i> or <i>haww harr herrer</i>. The series may be introduced by faster <i>hahahahahaha</i> calls suggestive of maniacal laughter, particularly when the bird is startled. Sometimes two birds call together at different pitches and tempos, producing a striking off-beat effect.<sup id="cite_ref-chct1996_5-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-chct1996-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Laughing Falcon has another call, typically given at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusk" title="Dusk">dusk</a>. This two-note call is preceded by a series of <i>gwa</i> notes given every half-second or so. They become more emphatic and after some time change to a sequence of the <i>gwa co</i> call proper, with the first syllable higher in pitch than the second, but not differing in emphasis or volume. The <i>gwa co</i> call may be repeated 50 times or more. Sometimes, the initial calls are a <i>oo oo-oo cow-cow-cow</i>, sometimes a descending <i>gwaaaaaaa....</i>. On occasion, the two-syllable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_call" title="Bird call" class="mw-redirect">call</a> is not given, and instead the simple <i>gwa</i> is repeated as often as the full call.<sup id="cite_ref-chct1996_5-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-chct1996-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The familiarity of these sounds in the American tropics is attested to by such common names as <i>acauã</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>), <i>halcón macagua</i>, <i>guaco</i>, <i>halcón guaco</i>, and <i>guaicurú</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>), and <i>guaycurú</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarani_language" title="Guarani language">Guaraní</a>).

The flight is slow, with quick, shallow wingbeats interspersed with glides; the bird rarely if ever <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(soaring)" title="Lift (soaring)">soars</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> When it lands, it will jerk the tail forcefully just like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagtail" title="Wagtail">wagtail</a>. A Laughing Falcon frequently and often conspicuously stays on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perch_(disambiguation)" title="Perch (disambiguation)">perch</a> for hours, sitting upright and observing the ground alertly, sometimes flicking its tail or nodding, or moving around a bit on its perch with slow, cautious little steps. It is generally peaceful and unlike other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon" title="Falcon">falcons</a> will not harm smaller birds.<sup id="cite_ref-chct1996_5-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-chct1996-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
It catches mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake" title="Snake">snakes</a>, including venomous ones such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_snake" title="Coral snake">coral snakes</a>, and also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard" title="Lizard">lizards</a>, and, to a lesser extent, small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent" title="Rodent">rodents</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat" title="Bat">bats</a><sup id="cite_ref-jj2003_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-jj2003-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede" title="Centipede">centipedes</a>. The Laughing Falcon pounces on its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey" title="Prey" class="mw-redirect">prey</a> from flight, often with an audible thud, and then biting it just behind the head, sometimes removing the head in the process. It carries the food to a perch to eat. It may carry small snakes in its bill and swallow them tail-first; big snakes may be carried head-forward in its claws, as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osprey" title="Osprey">Osprey</a> carries a fish, and then torn to pieces.<sup id="cite_ref-chct1996_5-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-chct1996-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Laughing Falcon breeds in rock crevices, tree cavities, or occasionally in abandoned nests of a <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteo" title="Buteo">Buteo</a></i> hawk or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracara" title="Caracara">caracara</a>; in general however it does not even gather nesting material in significant quantities. It lays one or two eggs according to some sources, but according to others<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> always just one. The eggs have heavy dark brown markings on a brown or whitish or pale buff background.
