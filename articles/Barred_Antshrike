There is one accepted record from southern Texas.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It is found in a wide range of wooded habitats (even gardens and parks) in both humid and arid regions.

The Barred Antshrike is typically 16.5&nbsp;cm long, and weighs 25 g. The male is barred all over with black and white, and has a white-based black crest that is raised in display. The female is rufous above with a chestnut crest. The sides of her head and neck are streaked with black, and the underparts are rich buff.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> vary primarily in the overall darkness and the amount of barring and hue of the underparts. For example, in the Tobagoian race <i>T. d. tobagensis</i> males are whiter below, and females darker, than in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominate_subspecies" title="Nominate subspecies" class="mw-redirect">nominate subspecies</a>. The most distinctive subspecies is <i>capistratus</i> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caatinga" title="Caatinga">Caatinga</a> in north-eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, where males have uniform black crown (no white barring to the base) and females have streaked throat and faintly barred belly. It is also the only subspecies where the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" title="Iris (anatomy)">iris</a> is deep maroon-red (not yellow). It has recently been suggested that it should be considered a separate species, the <b>Caatinga Barred Antshrike</b>.
It is typically found as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)" title="Territory (animal)">territorial</a> pairs. The female lays two purple-marked creamy white eggs in a deep cup nest in a shrub, which are incubated by both sexes for 14 days to hatching. The chicks fledge in another 12â€“13 days.
