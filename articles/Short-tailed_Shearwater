The <b>Short-tailed Shearwater</b> or <b>Slender-billed Shearwater</b> (<i>Puffinus tenuirostris</i>), also called <b>Yolla</b> or <b>Moonbird</b>, and commonly known as the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muttonbird" title="Muttonbird">muttonbird</a></b> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, is the most abundant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> species in Australian waters, and is one of the few Australian native birds in which the chicks are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muttonbirding" title="Muttonbirding">commercially harvested</a>. The chicks are caught in nets then put the bird in boiling water for a few seconds. It is a migratory species that breeds mainly on small islands in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Strait" title="Bass Strait">Bass Strait</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and migrates to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere" title="Northern Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> for the boreal summer. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooty_Shearwater" title="Sooty Shearwater">Sooty Shearwater</a> is the local 'muttonbird', and other harvested petrel species, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge-tailed_Shearwater" title="Wedge-tailed Shearwater">Wedge-tailed Shearwater</a>, may be known as muttonbirds elsewhere.
This species appears to be related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooty_Shearwater" title="Sooty Shearwater">New Zealand muttonbird</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Shearwater" title="Great Shearwater">Great Shearwater</a>, all blunt-tailed, black-billed species, but its precise relationships are obscure (Austin, 1996; Austin <i>et al.</i>, 2004). These are among the larger species of shearwater which might belong into a separate genus, <i>Ardenna</i> (Penhallurick &amp; Wink, 2004).
Each parent feeds the single chick for 2â€“3 days and then leaves for up to three weeks in search of food. These foraging trips can cover a distance of 1,500&nbsp;km (930&nbsp;mi) and mean the chick may be left unattended for over a week. When the chicks fledge they weigh around 900 g (2&nbsp;lb), and may be heavier than their parents. In Tasmania, and especially on the muttonbird islands of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furneaux_Group" title="Furneaux Group">Furneaux Group</a>, the chicks are harvested at this time for food and oil. The largest population in the world (2.8 millions of pairs - about 12% of this species) seems to be located on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_Island" title="Babel Island">Babel Island</a>.

Being a seabird, the flesh is covered in a considerable quantity of fat, which is normally removed in preparation of the meat before cooking.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from July 2010">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
When split down the breast and cooked on a barbecue, the resultant meat is red and thick, with a taste reminiscent of a beef steak more than of lamb, with a mild hint of the sea. The texture of the meat is similar to lamb or mutton and hence the name <i>muttonbird</i>. The dish is best eaten using one's hands rather than a knife and fork.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from July 2010">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
