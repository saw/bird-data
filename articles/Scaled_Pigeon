The <b>Scaled Pigeon</b> (<i>Patagioenas speciosa</i>)<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a> tropical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dove" title="Dove" class="mw-redirect">dove</a>. It is a resident breeder from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> south to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>.
The Scaled Pigeon is fairly common in semi-open forest. It builds a stick platform <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> in a tree and lays two white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>.
Its flight is high, fast and direct, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. It is usually very wary, since it is frequently hunted.
The Scaled Pigeon is 36&nbsp;cm long and weighs normally about 290&nbsp;g . Adult males have mainly purple brown plumage, with a paler scaly appearance to the neck and underparts. The lower underparts are whitish edged with purple. The eyering, legs and bill are red, the latter having a white tip. The female is dull dark brown rather than purplish, and is slightly smaller than the male.
Scaled Pigeons feed mainly on forest fruits and seeds. The call is a series of deep cooing <i>cro ku-k</i>s that differs markedly from that of its relatives, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-crowned_Pigeon" title="White-crowned Pigeon">White-crowned Pigeon</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> This is a solitary bird which does not form flocks.
The Scaled Pigeon has been recorded as successfully nesting on a fern (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i> (L.) Kuhn at ground level, and in the canopy of the tree fern (<i>Cyathea cyatheoides</i> Kramer). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Kite" title="Pearl Kite">Pearl Kite</a> visits nests of this species as a natural predator.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
