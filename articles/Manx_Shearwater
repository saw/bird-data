<i>Procellaria puffinus</i> <small class="vcard"><span class="fn">Brünnich</span>,&nbsp;1764</small>
The <b>Manx Shearwater</b> (<i>Puffinus puffinus</i>) is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearwater" title="Shearwater">shearwater</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procellariidae" title="Procellariidae">Procellariidae</a>. The scientific name of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> records a name shift: Manx Shearwaters were called Manks Puffins in the 17th century. Puffin is an Anglo-Norman word (Middle English <i>pophyn</i>) for the cured carcasses of nestling shearwaters. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Puffin" title="Atlantic Puffin">Atlantic Puffin</a> acquired the name much later, possibly because of its similar nesting habits.<sup id="cite_ref-leehaney1996_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-leehaney1996-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> is 30–38&nbsp;cm long, with a 76–89&nbsp;cm wingspan. It has the typically "shearing" flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wingbeats, the wingtips almost touching the water. This bird looks like a flying cross, with its wing held at right angles to the body, and it changes from black to white as the black upperparts and white undersides are alternately exposed as it travels low over the sea.
At some time or another, every living one of the middle-sized species of <i>Puffinus</i> has been considered a subspecies of <i>P. puffinus</i>. The extant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelkouan_Shearwater" title="Yelkouan Shearwater">Yelkouan Shearwater</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balearic_Shearwater" title="Balearic Shearwater">Balearic Shearwater</a> (Sangster <i>et al.</i> 2002), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutton%27s_Shearwater" title="Hutton's Shearwater">Hutton's Shearwater</a><sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-vented_Shearwater" title="Black-vented Shearwater">Black-vented Shearwater</a><sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsend%27s_Shearwater" title="Townsend's Shearwater">Townsend's Shearwater</a><sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Shearwater" title="Hawaiian Shearwater" class="mw-redirect">Hawaiian Shearwater</a><sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluttering_Shearwater" title="Fluttering Shearwater">Fluttering Shearwater</a><sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> are now considered good species. Of these, only the Hawaiian and possibly Townsend's Shearwaters seem to be somewhat closely related to the Manx Shearwater (Austin 1996); the former <i>Puffinus puffinus</i> "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superspecies" title="Superspecies">superspecies</a>" has turned out to be a number of more or less distantly related lineages. However, including the extinct forms listed below, at least the Mediterranean taxa do apparently constitute a superspecies in their own right, and maybe the New Zealand ones also.
Also belonging to this complex seem to be several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct" title="Extinct" class="mw-redirect">extinct</a> species:
undescribed remains found on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menorca" title="Menorca" class="mw-redirect">Menorca</a> may belong to an already-named or a new taxon; they are not from the Balearic Shearwater (Alcover 2001) which is possibly closer to <i>P. holeae</i> than to any other known species, living or extinct<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>. There also existed a Late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene" title="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>/Early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene" title="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> species known from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibiza" title="Ibiza">Ibiza</a>, <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffinus_nestori" title="Puffinus nestori">Puffinus nestori</a></i>, which may have been the direct ancestor of the Mediterranean Shearwater (Heidrich <i>et al.</i> 1998).
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic" title="Atlantic" class="mw-redirect">Atlantic</a> forms are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapatric" title="Parapatric" class="mw-redirect">parapatric</a> whereas the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Pacific</a> forms are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatric" title="Sympatric" class="mw-redirect">sympatric</a> or were not too long ago (Holdaway <i>et al.</i> 2001) and are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_isolation" title="Reproductive isolation">reproductively isolated</a> by a different <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/circannual" class="extiw" title="wikt:circannual">circannual</a> rhythm.
The prefix Manx, meaning from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>, originated owing to the once large colony of Manx Shearwaters found on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf_of_Man" title="Calf of Man">Calf of Man</a> (a small island just south of the Isle of Man). The species became extinct as a breeding bird there owing to the accidental introduction of rats from a shipwreck in the late 18th century; however a recent control program has resulted in Manx Shearwaters returning to breed in small numbers.
They are long-lived. A Manx Shearwater breeding on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeland_Island" title="Copeland Island" class="mw-redirect">Copeland Island</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, was as of 2003/2004 the oldest known living wild bird in the world: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_ringing" title="Bird ringing">ringed</a> as an adult (at least 5 years old) in July 1953, it was retrapped in July 2003, at least 55 years old<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from December 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>.
This is a gregarious species, which can been seen in large numbers from boats or headlands, especially on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">passage</a> in autumn. It is silent at sea, but at night the breeding colonies are alive with raucous cackling calls.
The Manx Shearwater feeds on small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> (particularly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herring" title="Herring">herring</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprat" title="Sprat">sprat</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardine" title="Sardine">sardines</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod" title="Cephalopod">cephalopods</a> and surface <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offal" title="Offal">offal</a>. The bird forages individually or in small flocks, and it makes use of feeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal" title="Marine mammal">marine mammals</a> and schools of predatory fish, which push prey species up to the surface. It does not follow boats.
This species breeds in the North Atlantic, with major colonies on islands and coastal cliffs around Great Britain and Ireland. These birds have been nesting along the Atlantic coast of northeastern North America since about 1970<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from December 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> and have since expanded their breeding range southward into the Gulf of Maine with a pair having been confirmed nesting at Matinicus Rock (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.fws.gov/FWSJournal/regmap.cfm?arskey=26734&amp;callingKey=state&amp;callingValue=ME">http://www.fws.gov/FWSJournal/regmap.cfm?arskey=26734&amp;callingKey=state&amp;callingValue=ME</a>). They nest in burrows, laying one white egg which is only visited at night to avoid predation by large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gulls</a>. The islands are usually free of mammalian predators (but on the island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B9m" title="Rùm">Rùm</a>, about 4&nbsp;percent of the chicks are preyed on by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Deer" title="Red Deer" class="mw-redirect">Red Deer</a> that need extra calcium.)<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> They form lifelong monogamous pair-bonds.
Manx Shearwaters <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> over 10,000&nbsp;km to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> in winter, using waters off southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> so the 55-year-old bird mentioned above probably covered over 1,000,000&nbsp;km on migration alone (not counting day-to-day fishing trips). Another bird ringed in 1957 and still breeding on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardsey_Island" title="Bardsey Island">Bardsey Island</a> off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a> in April 2002, was calculated by ornithologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Mead" title="Chris Mead">Chris Mead</a> to have flown over 8 million km (5 million miles) during its life.
In the nineteenth century Manx novel 'The Manxman' by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Hall_Caine" title="Sir Hall Caine" class="mw-redirect">Sir Hall Caine</a>, a reference is made to the satanic folklore surrounding the Manx shearwater, apparently due to its unusual call and dark appearance.
