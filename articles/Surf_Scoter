The <b>Surf Scoter</b> (<i>Melanitta perspicillata</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merginae" title="Merginae">sea duck</a>, which breeds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>. It is placed in the subgenus <i>Melanitta</i>, along with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Scoter" title="Velvet Scoter">Velvet</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-winged_Scoter" title="White-winged Scoter">White-winged Scoters</a>, distinct from the subgenus <i>Oidemia</i>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Scoter" title="Black Scoter">Black</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Scoter" title="Common Scoter">Common Scoters</a>.
It <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">winters</a> further south in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate" title="Temperate" class="mw-redirect">temperate</a> zones, on the coasts of the northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">USA</a>. Small numbers regularly winter in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. Some birds may over-winter on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>. It forms large flocks on suitable coastal waters. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off together.
The lined nest is built on the ground close to the sea, lakes or rivers, in woodland or tundra. 5-9 eggs are laid. An egg may range from 55-79 grams (1.9-2.8&nbsp;oz) and average 43.9&nbsp;mm (1.7&nbsp;inches) in breadth and 62.4&nbsp;mm (2.5&nbsp;inches) in length. Occasional (and likely accidental) brood mixing between different females occurs in areas with high densities of nests. Growth is relatively rapid and the incubation period is about 28 to 30 days. The offspring will fledge independently at about 55 days.
The adult female averages about 900 grams (2&nbsp;lbs.) and 44&nbsp;cm (17&nbsp;inches) in length, while the adult male is on average 1050 grams (2.3&nbsp;lbs.) and 48&nbsp;cm (19&nbsp;inches) in length, making this the smallest species of scoter on average. It is characterised by its bulky shape and large bill. The male is all black, except for white patches on the nape and forehead. It has a bulbous red, yellow and white bill. The females are brown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a> with pale head patches. The wedge-shaped head and lack of white in the wings helps to distinguish female Surf Scoters from female <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Scoter" title="Velvet Scoter">Velvet Scoters</a>.
Adult scoters of this species dive for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusc" title="Mollusc" class="mw-redirect">molluscs</a>, while the ducklings live off any variety of freshwater <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a>.
In November, 2007, an oil spill in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> harbour oiled and killed thousands of birds including many Surf Scoters. About 40 per cent of the birds affected were from this species. Scientists said that while the species is not endangered it has declined 50 to 70 per cent over the past 40 years and this spill could decrease populations since most of the affected birds are healthy adults.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
