The <b>Sage Thrasher</b> (<i>Oreoscoptes montanus</i>) is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perching_bird" title="Perching bird" class="mw-redirect">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> from the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimidae" title="Mimidae" class="mw-redirect">Mimidae</a>, which also includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockingbird" title="Mockingbird">mockingbirds</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trembler" title="Trembler">tremblers</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_catbird" title="New World catbird" class="mw-redirect">New World catbirds</a>. It is the only member of the genus <i><b>Oreoscoptes</b></i>. This seems less close to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> thrashers, but rather to the mockingbirds instead (Hunt <i>et al.</i> 2001, Barber <i>et al.</i> 2004).
<i>O. montanus</i> are pale grey-brown on the upperparts and white on the underparts with dark streaks. They have a slim straight relatively short bill, yellow eyes and a long tail, although not as long as that of other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrasher" title="Thrasher">thrashers</a>.
As its name suggests, this bird breeds in western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>. Its breeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_(ecology)" title="Habitat (ecology)" class="mw-redirect">habitat</a> is in areas with dense stands of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagebrush" title="Sagebrush">sagebrush</a> and rarely in other shrubby areas. The female lays 4 or 5 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> in a twiggy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">cup nest</a> built in a low bush. Both parents <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubate_(bird)" title="Incubate (bird)" class="mw-redirect">incubate</a> and feed the young birds.
In winter, these birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to the southernmost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_Peninsula" title="Baja Peninsula" class="mw-redirect">Baja Peninsula</a>, north and south.
They mainly eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> in summer; they also eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry" title="Berry">berries</a>, especially in winter. They usually search for insects on the ground in brushy locations.
The male bird sings a series of warbled notes to defend his nesting territory.
These birds have declined in some areas where sagebrush has been removed but are still common where suitable habitat remains. The continued decline of sagebrush habitats in western North America is cause for alarm for this and other sagebrush dependent species.
