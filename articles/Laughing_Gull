<i>Leucophaeus atricilla</i>
The <b>Laughing Gull</b> (<i>Leucophaeus atricilla</i>) is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">gull</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>. It breeds on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> coast of North America, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, and northern South America. Northernmost populations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> further south in winter, and this species occurs as a rare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrancy_(biology)" title="Vagrancy (biology)">vagrant</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe" title="Western Europe">western Europe</a>. (There was an influx into North-west Europe in late October 2005 when at least 18, possibly as many as 35, individuals occurred on one day in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> alone.) The Laughing Gull's English name is derived from its raucous <i>kee-agh</i> call, which sounds like a high-pitched laugh "ha... ha... ha...".
This species is easy to identify. It is 36–41 cm (14–16 in) long with a 98–110 cm (39–43 in) wingspan. The summer adult's body is white apart from the dark grey back and wings and black head. Its wings are much darker grey than all other gulls of similar size except the smaller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%27s_Gull" title="Franklin's Gull">Franklin's Gull</a>, and they have black tips without the white crescent shown by Franklin's. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">beak</a> is long and red. The black hood is mostly lost in winter.
Laughing Gulls take three years to reach adult plumage. Immature birds are always darker than most similar-sized gulls other than Franklin's. First-year birds are greyer below and have paler heads than first-year Franklin's, and second-years can be distinguished by the wing pattern and structure.
Laughing Gulls breed in coastal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a> and ponds in large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_colony" title="Bird colony">colonies</a>. The large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a>, made largely from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass" title="Grass">grasses</a>, is constructed on the ground. The 3 or 4 greenish eggs are incubated for about three weeks. These are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore" title="Omnivore">omnivores</a> like most gulls, and they will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger" title="Scavenger">scavenge</a> as well as seeking suitable small prey.
Like most other members of the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucophaeus" title="Leucophaeus">Leucophaeus</a></i>, the Laughing Gull was long placed in the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larus" title="Larus">Larus</a></i>.
