The <b>Northern Flicker</b> (<i>Colaptes auratus</i>) is a medium-sized member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> family. It is native to most of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands" title="Cayman Islands">Cayman Islands</a>, and is one of the few woodpecker species that migrate. There are over 100 common names for the Northern Flicker. Among them are: Yellowhammer, clape, gaffer woodpecker, harry-wicket, heigh-ho, wake-up, walk-up, wick-up, yarrup, and gawker bird. Many of these names are attempts at imitating some of its calls.
The Northern Flicker is part of the genus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colaptes" title="Colaptes">Colaptes</a> which encompasses 12 New-World woodpeckers. There are two living and one extinct subspecies of <i>C. auratus</i> species. The existing sub-species were at one time considered separate species but they commonly interbreed where ranges overlap and are now considered one species by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists_Union" title="American Ornithologists Union" class="mw-redirect">American Ornithologists Union</a>. Whether or not they are separate species is a well-known example of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_problem" title="Species problem">species problem</a>.
Adults are brown with black bars on the back and wings. A mid-to-large-sized woodpecker, it measures 28–36 cm (11–14 in) in length and 42–54 cm (17–21 in) in wingspan.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The body mass can vary from 86 to 167 g (3.0 to 5.9 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Among standard scientific measurements, the wing bone measures 12.2–17.1 cm (4.8–6.7 in), the tail measures 7.5–11.5 cm (3.0–4.5 in), the bill measures 2.2–4.3 cm (0.87–1.7 in) and the tarsus measures 2.2–3.1 cm (0.87–1.2 in). The largest-bodied specimens are from the northern stretches of the species range, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="Newfoundland and Labrador">Newfoundland and Labrador</a>, whereas the smallest specimens come from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Cayman_Island" title="Grand Cayman Island" class="mw-redirect">Grand Cayman Island</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necklace" title="Necklace">necklace</a>-like black patch occupies the upper breast, while the lower breast and belly are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beige" title="Beige">beige</a> with black spots. Males can be identified by a black or red <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moustache" title="Moustache">moustachial</a> stripe at the base of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">beak</a>. The tail is dark on top, transitioning to a white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_anatomy" title="Bird anatomy">rump</a> which is conspicuous in flight.
The subspecies plumage varies as described in Taxonomy section.
This bird's call is a sustained laugh, <i>ki ki ki ki ...</i>, more congenial than that of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileated_Woodpecker" title="Pileated Woodpecker">Pileated Woodpecker</a>. One may also hear a constant knocking as they often drum on trees or even metal objects to declare territory. Like most woodpeckers, Northern Flickers drum on objects as a form of communication and territory defense. In such cases, the object is to make as loud a noise as possible, and that’s why woodpeckers sometimes drum on metal objects. One Northern Flicker in Wyoming could be heard drumming on an abandoned tractor from a half-mile away.
Like many woodpeckers, its flight is undulating. The repeated cycle of a quick succession of flaps followed by a pause creates an effect comparable to a rollercoaster.
According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audubon_Society" title="National Audubon Society">Audubon</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_guide" title="Field guide">guide</a>, "flickers are the only woodpeckers that frequently feed on the ground", probing with their beak, also sometimes catching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> in flight. Although they eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a>, berries, seeds and nuts, their primary food is insects. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">Ants</a> alone can make up 45% of their diet. Other invertebrates eaten include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diptera" title="Diptera" class="mw-redirect">flies</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly" title="Butterfly">butterflies</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth" title="Moth">moths</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleoptera" title="Coleoptera" class="mw-redirect">beetles</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail" title="Snail">snails</a>. Flickers also eat berries and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeds" title="Seeds" class="mw-redirect">seeds</a>, especially in winter, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_oak" title="Poison oak">poison oak</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_ivy" title="Poison ivy" class="mw-redirect">ivy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogwood" title="Dogwood" class="mw-redirect">dogwood</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumac" title="Sumac">sumac</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_cherry" title="Wild cherry" class="mw-redirect">wild cherry</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitis" title="Vitis">grape</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayberry" title="Bayberry" class="mw-redirect">bayberries</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackberry" title="Hackberry">hackberries</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elderberry" title="Elderberry" class="mw-redirect">elderberries</a>, and sunflower and thistle seeds. Flickers often go after ants <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony" title="Ant colony">underground</a> (where the nutritious larvae live), hammering at the soil the way other woodpeckers drill into wood. They have been observed breaking into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_pat" title="Cow pat" class="mw-redirect">cow patties</a> to eat insects living within. Their tongues can dart out 2&nbsp;inches beyond the end of the bill to snare prey. As well as eating ants, flickers have a behavior called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anting_(bird_activity)" title="Anting (bird activity)">anting</a>, during which they use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formic_acid" title="Formic acid">acid</a> from the ants to assist in preening, as it is useful in keeping them free of parasites.
Flickers may be obseved in open habitats near trees, including woodlands, edges, yards, and parks. In the western United States, one can find them in mountain forests all the way up to treeline. Northern Flickers generally nest in holes in trees like other woodpeckers. Occasionally, they have been found nesting in old, earthen burrows vacated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belted_Kingfisher" title="Belted Kingfisher">Belted Kingfishers</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Martin" title="Sand Martin">Bank Swallows</a>. Both sexes help with nest excavation. The entrance hole is about 3&nbsp;inches in diameter, and the cavity is 13-16&nbsp;inches deep. The cavity widens at bottom to make room for eggs and the incubating adult. Inside, the cavity is bare except for a bed of wood chips for the eggs and chicks to rest on. Once nestlings are about 17 days old, they begin clinging to the cavity wall rather than lying on the floor.
The oldest yet known "yellow-shafted" Northern Flicker lived to be at least 9 years 2 months old, and the oldest yet known “red-shafted” Northern Flicker lived to be at least 8 years 9 months old.
Their breeding habitat consists of forested areas across North America and as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>. They are cavity nesters who typically nest in trees though they will also use posts and birdhouses if sized and situated appropriately. They prefer to excavate their own home though they will reuse and repair damaged or abandoned nests. Abandoned flicker nests create habitat for other cavity nesters. Flickers are sometimes driven from nesting sites by another cavity nester, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Starling" title="European Starling" class="mw-redirect">European starlings</a>.
It takes about 1 to 2 weeks to build the nest which is built by both sexes of the mating pairs. The entrance hole is roughly 5&nbsp;cm to 10&nbsp;cm wide.
A typical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)" title="Clutch (eggs)">clutch</a> consists of 6 to 8 eggs whose shells are pure white with a smooth surface and high gloss. The eggs are the second largest of the North American woodpecker species, exceeded only by the Pileated Woodpecker's. Incubation is by both sexes for approximately 11 to 12 days. The young are fed by regurgitation and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> about 25 to 28 days after hatching.
Northern birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to the southern parts of the range; southern birds are often permanent residents.
