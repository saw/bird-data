The <b>Snail Kite</b> (<i>Rostrhamus sociabilis</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">bird of prey</a> within the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipitridae" title="Accipitridae">Accipitridae</a>, which also includes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle" title="Eagle">eagles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawks</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_vulture" title="Old World vulture">Old World vultures</a>. Its relative, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slender-billed_Kite" title="Slender-billed Kite">Slender-billed Kite</a>, is now again placed in <i>Helicolestes</i>, making the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><b>Rostrhamus</b></i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic" title="Monotypic" class="mw-redirect">monotypic</a>. Usually placed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milvinae" title="Milvinae" class="mw-redirect">milvine kites</a>, the validity of that group is under investigation.
Snail Kites are 36 to 48 cm (14 to 19 in) long with a 99–120 cm (39–47 in) wingspan. They weigh from 300 to 570 grams (11 to 20 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> There is very limited sexual dimorphism, with the female averaging only 3% larger than the male. They have long, broad, and rounded wings, which measure 29–33 cm (11–13 in) each. Its tail is long, at 16–21 cm (6.3–8.3 in), with a white rump and undertail coverts. The dark, deeply hooked beak, measuring 2.9–4 cm (1.1–1.6 in) is an adaptation to its diet. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">tarsus</a> is relatively long as well, measuring 3.6–5.7 cm (1.4–2.2 in).<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The adult male has dark blue-gray <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> with darker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">flight feathers</a>. The legs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cere" title="Cere" class="mw-redirect">cere</a> are red. The adult female has dark brown upperparts and heavily streaked pale underparts. She has a whitish face with darker areas behind and above the eye. The legs and cere are yellow or orange. The immature is similar to adult female, but the crown is streaked.
It flies slowly with its head facing downwards, looking for its main food, the large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampullariidae" title="Ampullariidae">apple snails</a>. For this reason, it is considered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molluscivore" title="Molluscivore">molluscivore</a>.
The Snail Kite breeds in tropical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, and central and southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. It is resident all-year in most of its range, but the southernmost population migrates north in winter and the Caribbean birds disperse widely outside the breeding season.
The Snail Kite is a locally endangered species in the Florida <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades" title="Everglades">Everglades</a>, with a population of less than 400 breeding pairs. Research has demonstrated <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draining_and_development_of_the_Everglades" title="Draining and development of the Everglades">water-level control</a> in the Everglades is depleting the population of apple snails. However, this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> is not generally threatened over its extensive range.
In fact, it might be locally increasing in numbers, such as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a>, it was first recorded in 1996. Since then, it has been regularly sighted, including immature birds, suggesting a resident breeding population might already exist in that country. On the other hand, most records are outside the breeding season, more indicative of post-breeding dispersal. In El Salvador, the species can be observed during the winter months at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerr%C3%B3n_Grande_Hydroelectric_Dam#Cerr.C3.B3n_Grande_Lake" title="Cerrón Grande Hydroelectric Dam" class="mw-redirect">Embalse Cerrón Grande</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Laguna_El_Jocotal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Laguna El Jocotal (page does not exist)">Laguna El Jocotal</a>, and especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lago_de_G%C3%BCija" title="Lago de Güija" class="mw-redirect">Lago de Güija</a>. <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomacea_flagellata" title="Pomacea flagellata">Pomacea flagellata</a></i> apple snails were propagated in El Salvador between 1982 and 1986 as food for fish stocks, and it seems that the widespread presence of high numbers of these snails has not gone unnoticed by the Snail Kite.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
This is a gregarious bird of freshwater <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland" title="Wetland">wetlands</a>, forming large winter roosts. Its diet consists almost exclusively of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampullariidae" title="Ampullariidae">apple snails</a>.
Snail Kites have been observed eating other prey items in Florida, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayfish" title="Crayfish">crayfish</a> in the genus <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procambarus" title="Procambarus">Procambarus</a></i> and Black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crappie" title="Crappie">Crappie</a>. It is believed that Snail Kites turn to these alternatives only when apple snails become scarce, such as during drought,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> but further study is needed. On 14 May 2007, a birdwatcher photographed a Snail Kite feeding at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procambarus_clarkii" title="Procambarus clarkii">Red Swamp Crayfish</a> farm in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarendon_County,_South_Carolina" title="Clarendon County, South Carolina">Clarendon County, South Carolina</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>
It nests in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub" title="Shrub">bush</a> or on the ground, laying 3–4 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg" title="Bird egg">eggs</a>.
