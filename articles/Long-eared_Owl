<i>Asio wilsonianus</i>
The <b>Long-eared Owl</b> - <i>Asio otus</i> (previously: <i>Strix otus</i>) is a species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owl</a> which breeds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. This species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typical_owl" title="Typical owl" class="mw-redirect">typical owls</a>, family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strigidae" title="Strigidae" class="mw-redirect">Strigidae</a>, which contains most species of owl. The other grouping of owls are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_owl" title="Barn owl" class="mw-redirect">barn owls</a>, family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tytonidae" title="Tytonidae">Tytonidae</a>.
The Long-eared Owl is a medium sized owl, 31–40 cm (12–16 in) in length with an 86–100 cm (34–39 in) wingspan and a body mass of 178–435 g (6.3–15.3 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> It has erect blackish ear-tufts, which are positioned in the center of the head. The ear-tufts are used to make the owl appear larger to other owls while perched. The female is larger in size and darker in coloration than the male. The Long-eared Owl’s brownish feathers are vertically streaked. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)" title="Tarsus (skeleton)">Tarsus</a> and toes are entirely feathered. Eye disks are also characteristic in this species. However, the eye disks of <i>A. otus</i> are darker in color or rusty-orange. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal" title="Nocturnal" class="mw-redirect">nocturnal</a> species is perhaps most easily seen perched in a tree in its daytime roost, sometimes in small groups during the winter months.
Over much of its range, Long-eared Owl occurs with the similar-looking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-eared_Owl" title="Short-eared Owl">Short-eared Owl</a>. At rest, the ear-tufts of Long-eared Owl serve to easily distinguish the two (although Long-eared Owl can sometimes hold its ear-tufts flat). The iris-colour differs: yellow in Short-eared, and orange in Long-eared, and the black surrounding the eyes is vertical on Long-eared, and horizontal on Short-eared. Overall Short-eared tends to be a paler, sandier bird than Long-eared. There are a number of other ways in which the two species differ which are best seen when they are flying:
The Long-eared Owl's breeding season is from February to July. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> is partially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, moving south in winter from the northern parts of its temperate range. Its habitat is forest close to open country.
It nests in trees, often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coniferous" title="Coniferous" class="mw-redirect">coniferous</a>, using the old stick nests of other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow" title="Crow">crows</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven" title="Raven">ravens</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magpie" title="Magpie">magpies</a> and various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk" title="Hawk">hawks</a>. The average clutch size is 4-6 eggs, and the incubation time averages from 25–30 days. It will readily use artificial nesting baskets. An unusual characteristic of this species is its communal roosting in thickets during the winter months. The young have a characteristic call, likened to a rusty hinge.
The Long-eared Owl hunts over open country by night. It is very long winged, like the similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-eared_Owl" title="Short-eared Owl">Short-eared Owl</a>, and glides slowly on stiff wings when hunting. Its food is mainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodents" title="Rodents" class="mw-redirect">rodents</a>, small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a>. In Europe it faces competition from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawny_owl" title="Tawny owl" class="mw-redirect">tawny owl</a> and is most numerous where the tawny is absent.
A number of subspecies have been noted in this species including <i>A. o. otus</i>, <i>A. o. canariensis</i>, <i>A. o. tuftsi</i> and <i>A. o. wilsonianus</i><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>

The print was engraved by Robert Havell in 1837. The original watercolor was purchased from Audubon's destitute widow by The New York History Society where it remains to this day.
