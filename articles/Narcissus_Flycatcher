It is native to east Asia, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakhalin" title="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a> to the north, through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> across through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea" title="Korea">Korea</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China" title="Mainland China">mainland China</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, wintering in southeast Asia, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borneo" title="Borneo">Borneo</a>. It is highly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, and has been found as a vagrant from Australia in the south to Alaska in the north <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.birdskorea.org/narcissustypes.asp">[1]</a>.
Narcissus Flycatcher males are very distinctive in full breeding plumage, having a black crown and mantle, a bright orange throat with paler chest and underparts, an orange-yellow eyebrow, black wings with a white wing patch, an orange-yellow rump, and a black tail. Non-breeding males have varying levels of yellow. Females are completely dissimilar, with generally buff-brown coloration, with rusty-colored wings, and a two-toned eyering.
This species primarily feeds on insects, and lives in deciduous woodlands. Breeding males sing in repeated melodious whistles.
There are several subspecies, largely determined by plumage and range variations, at least of which has been split off as separate species.
"<i>F. beijingnica</i>", proposed as a separate species called <b>Beijing Flycatcher</b> or <b>Peking Flycatcher</b>, is now considered by experts to be the first-summer male of <i>F. (n.) elisae</i> and thus no longer a valid taxon <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.montereybay.com/creagrus/muscicapids.html">[2]</a>.
The name of the bird is a reference to the yellow color of many varieties of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_(genus)" title="Narcissus (genus)" class="mw-redirect">narcissus</a> flower.
