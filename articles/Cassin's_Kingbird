The <b>Cassin's Kingbird</b> (<i>Tyrannus vociferans</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher" title="Tyrant flycatcher">tyrant flycatcher</a> native to western North America. The name of this bird commemorates the American ornithologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassin" title="John Cassin">John Cassin</a>.
Adults have a gray head with slightly darker cheeks; a dark unforked tail with a buffy fringe and gray-olive underparts. They have a pale throat and deep yellow lower breast.
Juveniles are duller and have pale edges on their wings.
The Cassin's kingbird and the western kingbird are similar in appearance. The Cassin's is a little larger than the western and the upper parts are a darker gray than the western but the most distinctive difference between the birds is that the Cassin's has a thin white strip along lower edge of the tail feathers and the western has a thin white strip that runs along the edge of the tail feathers.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> This difference can be seen in the image on the left.
In the summer these birds can be found in California and from Montana to Utah, along the eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>.

These birds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to their winter quarters between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California" title="Southern California">Southern California</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>. They are permanent residents in south-central Mexico, and their main wintering ranges are west of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Cortez" title="Sea of Cortez" class="mw-redirect">Sea of Cortez</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California_Sur" title="Baja California Sur">Baja California Sur</a>, and east of the sea on the mainland of western Mexico.
They build a bulky nest on a horizontal tree limb in mid-story or the canopy of trees. The three to five spotted white eggs have an incubation period of 18 to 19 days.
The Cassin's kingbird primarily feeds on insects it preys upon from high perches by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_(birds)" title="Hawking (birds)">hawking</a>. It also eats berries and fruits in lesser quantities.
The call is a high-pitched shorter followed by a longer chirp, sounding like a 'chi-beer'.
In early spring, presumably after having chosen (or shown up with) their mate, they launch into a peculiar dance. With excited high-pitched calls, they hover in unison, wings outstretched, over a favorite perch. This dance takes place several times a day over several days, over several separate sites in an area covering two or 3 acres (12,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>). The sites chosen for the dance appear to be the same sites used as hunting perches during the spring and summer.
