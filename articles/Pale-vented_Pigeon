<i>Columba cayennensis</i> <small>Bonnaterre, 1792</small>
The <b>Pale-vented Pigeon</b> (<i>Patagioenas cayennensis</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon" title="Pigeon" class="mw-redirect">pigeon</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae" title="Columbidae">Columbidae</a>) found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical" title="Tropical" class="mw-redirect">tropical</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">American</a>. Formerly often placed in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columba_(genus)" title="Columba (genus)">Columba</a></i>, it actually belongs to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade" title="Clade">clade</a> of the older <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagioenas" title="Patagioenas">Patagioenas</a></i>. With its relatives it represents an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_radiation" title="Evolutionary radiation">evolutionary radiation</a> extending through most of the warm-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate" title="Temperate" class="mw-redirect">temperate</a> to tropical Americas. Grey-hued birds, even their males generally lack iridescent display plumage, although the present species has some coppery gloss on the nape.<sup id="cite_ref-Johnson_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Johnson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
It is a resident breeder from southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> and on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobago" title="Tobago">Tobago</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, although it is very localised on the latter island. Vagrants are occasionally seen in adjacent regions; for example, the species is noted to stray into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> from Argentina and occasionally from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, but it has never been noted to breed or even maintain a permanent presence in the former country.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Pale-vented Pigeon is 30–32&nbsp;cm long and weighs normally 230–250&nbsp;g. Adult males have a mainly dull purple head, breast and upperpart plumage, with copper glossing on the nape and a whitish throat. The lower back and tail are dark grey and the lower underparts are pale grey. The bill is black and the legs, iris and eyering are red. The female is similar, but duller than the male, and immatures are greyish-brown, very dull, and mainly greyish brown.
The southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> <i>P. c. andersoni</i> has white lower underparts, rather than the pale grey of nominate <i>P. c. cayennensis</i>.
The call is a row of soft <i>kuk kuk croo-ooo</i>s; the initial short <i>kuk</i> is characteristic for the "<i>cayennensis</i> group" of <i>Patagioenas</i>. Altogether, this species' song is intermediate between that of its close relatives the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Pigeon" title="Plain Pigeon">Plain</a> (<i>P. inornata</i>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-billed_Pigeon" title="Red-billed Pigeon">Red-billed Pigeons</a> (<i>P. flavirostris</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-Johnson_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Johnson-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Mahler_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mahler-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
It may in the field resemble a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Pigeon" title="Scaled Pigeon">Scaled Pigeon</a> (<i>P. speciosa</i>), which has a similar display flight. These two large species are also the only pigeons in their range which are often seen flying in the open away from forests. But of course <i>P. cayennensis</i> lacks the scaly appearance, and the calls<sup id="cite_ref-Mahler_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mahler-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> and appearance from close by indicate that the two are not particularly close relatives among their congeners.
The Pale-vented Pigeon is common at forest edges, riverbanks, and other partially open areas with some trees. It feeds mainly on small fruits, berries and seed. This is a fairly solitary bird, but may form small flocks at drinking areas. Its flight is high, fast and direct, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general.
It also has a breeding display with a semi-circular glide down to its original perch. It builds a small twig <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest" title="Bird nest">nest</a> in a small tree, and normally lays one white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">egg</a>.
Widespread and common, it is classified a Species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern" title="Least Concern">Least Concern</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
