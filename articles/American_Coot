The <b>American Coot</b> (<i>Fulica americana</i>) is a bird of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallidae" title="Rallidae">Rallidae</a>, inhabiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetlands" title="Wetlands" class="mw-redirect">wetlands</a> and open water bodies. Groups of coots are called <b>covers</b> or <b>rafts</b>.
The American Coot measures 34–43 cm (13–17 in) in length and 58–71 cm (23–28 in) across the wings. Adults have a short thick white bill and white frontal shield, which usually has a reddish-brown spot near the top of the bill between the eyes. Body mass in females ranges from 427 to 628 g (0.94 to 1.38 lb) and in males from 576 to 848 g (1.27 to 1.87 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Upon close examination, a dark band can be distinguished at the bill tip. The body is grey with the head and neck darker than the rest of the body. Its legs are yellowish, with lobed toes in place of webbed feet. American Coot chicks have black bodies with bright red head and beak, and orange plumes around the neck. The bird's call is a high-pitched squeaking honk similar to that of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose" title="Goose">goose</a>, but with a more hollow sound.
The American coot requires a great deal of effort to become airborne, pedaling across the water with its feet before lifting off. The way in its their heads bob when it walks or swims has earned it the name <b>"marsh hen"</b>or <b>"mud hen"</b>. Though it appears to be a weak flier, like most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallidae" title="Rallidae">rails</a> it has considerable stamina once airborne. This species has crossed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> to reach western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> at least 23 times since records began<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers"><span title="The time period in the vicinity of this tag is ambiguous from December 2010">when?</span></a></i>]</sup>, including 12 records in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores" title="Azores">Azores</a> and four in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. In December 2003, an individual of this species attempted to overwinter in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland_Islands" title="Shetland Islands" class="mw-redirect">Shetland Islands</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Two sightings have occurred in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> as well.
The American Coot has a variety of repeated calls and sounds. Male and female Coots make different types of calls to similar situations. Male alarm calls are “puhlk” while female alarm calls are “poonk”. Also, stressed males go “puhk-cowah” or “pow-ur” while females call “cooah”.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoyo_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hoyo-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The American Coot can dive for food but can also forage and scavenge on land. It is omnivorous, eating plant material, arthropods, fish, and other aquatic animals. It’s principle source of food is aquatic vegetation, especially algae. During breeding season, Coots are more likely to eat aquatic insects and mollusks—which constitute the majority of a chicks diet.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoyo_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hoyo-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
American Coots are found near water—reed-ringed lakes and ponds, open marshes, and sluggish rivers. They prefer freshwater environments, but may temporarily live in saltwater environments during the winter months.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoyo_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hoyo-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The American Coot's breeding habitat extends from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a> in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Pacific</a> coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and as far south as northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>. Birds from temperate North America east of the Rocky Mountains <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to the southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>. It is often a year-round resident where water remains open in winter. It is notable that in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> birds apparently move to their breeding range about half a month earlier and leave for winter quarters later than they did 100 years ago. The number of birds that stay year-round near the northern limit of the species' range seems to be increasing.
The American Coot is highly territorial, with both males and females fighting with neighbors to maintain a small territory where they obtain all their food. This aggression is ongoing and not just observed during the breeding season.
Coot mate pairings are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous" title="Monogamous" class="mw-redirect">monogamous</a> throughout their life, given they have a suitable territory. A typical reproductive cycle involves multiple stages: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing" title="Pairing">pairing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest" title="Nest">nesting</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copulation" title="Copulation" class="mw-redirect">copulation</a>, egg deposition, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubation</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatching" title="Hatching">hatching</a><sup id="cite_ref-gordon_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gordon-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>. The American Coot typically has long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship" title="Courtship">courtship</a> periods. This courtship period is characterized by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak#Billing" title="Beak">billing</a>, bowing, and nibbling. Males generally initiate billing, which is the touching of bills between individuals. As the pair bond becomes more evident, both males and females will initiate billing only with each other and not other males or females. After a pair bond is cemented, the mating pair looks for a territory to build a nest in. A pair bond becomes permanent when a nesting territory is secured.<sup id="cite_ref-gordon_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gordon-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copulation" title="Copulation" class="mw-redirect">Copulation</a> behavior among Coot pairs always falls under the same general pattern<sup id="cite_ref-gordon_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gordon-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>. First the male chases the female. Then, the female moves to the display platform and squats with her head under the water. The male then mounts the female, using his claws and wings to balance on the female's back while the she brings her head above the water. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Intercourse" title="Sexual Intercourse" class="mw-redirect">Intromission</a> usually takes no longer than two seconds.
The American Coot is a prolific builder and will create multiple structures during a single breeding season. It nests in well-concealed locations in tall reeds. There are three general types of structures: display platforms, egg nests and brood nests<sup id="cite_ref-gordon_7-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gordon-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>.
Since American Coots build on the water, their structures disintegrate easily and have short life spans. Egg and brood nests are actually elaborate rafts, and must be constantly added to in order to stay afloat. Females typically do the most work while building.
Females deposit one egg a day until the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch" title="Clutch">clutch</a> is complete. Eggs are usually deposited between sunset and midnight. Typically, early season and first clutches average two more eggs than second nestings and late season clutches. Early season nests see an average of 9.0 eggs per clutch while late clutches see an average of 6.4 eggs per clutch. There is an inverse relationship between egg weights and laying sequence<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>, wherein earlier eggs are larger than eggs laid later in the sequence. It is possible to induce a female Coot to lay more eggs than normal by either removing all or part of her clutch. Sometimes, a female may abandon the clutch if enough eggs are removed. Coots, however, do not respond to experimental addition of eggs by laying fewer eggs<sup id="cite_ref-continuouslaying_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-continuouslaying-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>.
The American Coot is a persistent re-nester, and will replace lost clutches with new ones within two days of clutch-loss during deposition. One study showed that 68% of destroyed clutches are eventually replaced. Re-nested clutches are typically smaller than original clutches by one or two eggs, but this could be attributed to differences in time and habitat quality instead of food or nutrient reserves and availability<sup id="cite_ref-factorsaffecting_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-factorsaffecting-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>.
Younger females reproduce later in the season and produce smaller eggs than older females. Their offspring are also smaller. However, there is no difference in clutch size between older and younger females like in other avian species<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">Incubation</a> start time in the American Coot is variable, and can begin anywhere from the deposition of the first egg to after the clutch is fully deposited. Starting incubation before the entire clutch has been laid is an uncommon practice among birds<sup id="cite_ref-anexperimentalstudy_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-anexperimentalstudy-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>. Once incubation starts it continues without interruption. Male and female Coots share incubation responsibility, but males do most of the work during the 21-day incubation period. Females will begin to re-nest clutches in an average of six days if clutches are destroyed during incubation<sup id="cite_ref-factorsaffecting_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-factorsaffecting-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>.
Hatch order usually follows the same sequence as laying order. Regardless of clutch size, eight is the typical maximum size of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring" title="Offspring">brood</a>. Egg desertion is a frequent occurrence among Coots because females will often deposit more than eight eggs. Brood size limits incubation time, and when a certain number of chicks have hatched the remaining eggs are abandoned. The mechanism for egg abandonment has not yet been discovered. Food resource constraints may limit the number of eggs parents let hatch, or the remaining eggs may not provide enough visual or tactile stimulation to elicit incubation behavior<sup id="cite_ref-anexperimentalstudy_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-anexperimentalstudy-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>. An American Coot can be forced to hatch more eggs than are normally laid. These additional offspring, however, suffer higher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate" title="Mortality rate">mortality rates</a> due to inadequacy in brooding or feeding ability<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> .
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormones" title="Hormones" class="mw-redirect">Hormones</a> that are passed down from the mother into the egg affect offspring growth, behavior, and social interactions. These nongenetic contributions by the mother are known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_effect" title="Maternal effect">maternal effects</a>. In the American Coot, two levels of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen" title="Androgen">androgen</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> variation have been discovered -- within-clutch and among-clutch variation. Within the same clutch, eggs laid earlier in the sequence have higher testosterone levels than eggs laid later in the sequence. Females that lay three clutches deposit more androgens into their yolks than females who lay only one or two clutches<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> .
Experiments in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_canary" title="Domestic canary" class="mw-redirect">domestic canaries</a> show that yolk androgen levels are correlated to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_hierarchy" title="Dominance hierarchy">social dominance</a> later in life, and testosterone treatments in eggs caused increased begging in the offspring<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>. While observable differences in androgen levels have been found in American Coot eggs, further research is needed to determine if the androgen effects in canaries are similar to the effects in American Coots. It is currently hypothesized that the variation in androgen levels exacerbates the effects of egg size variation, and that offspring from larger eggs will often have more androgens and are more likely to survive.
The American Coot has a mixed reproductive strategy, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific" title="Conspecific" class="mw-redirect">conspecific</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite" title="Brood parasite">brood parasitism</a> is a common alternative reproductive method. In one 4-year study, researchers found that 40% of nests were parasitized, and that 13% of all eggs were laid parasitically.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> Increasing reproductive success under social and ecological constraints is the primary reason for brood parasitism. Floater females without territories or nests use brood parasitism as their primary method of reproduction, if they breed at all. Other females may engage in brood parasitism if their partially complete clutches are destroyed. Conspecific brood parasitic behavior is most common among females trying to increase their total number of offspring. Food supply is the limiting factor to chick survival and starvation is the most common cause of chick morbidity. Parasitic females bypass the parental care constraint of feeding by laying additional parasitic eggs in addition to their normal nest.
When a parasitic female lays her egg in a host female’s nest, the host female experiences a deposition rate of two eggs per day. Host females may recognize parasitic eggs when the egg deposition pattern deviates from the traditional one egg per day pattern<sup id="cite_ref-continuouslaying_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-continuouslaying-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> . The occurrence of brood parasitism may be influenced by the body size of the potential parasitic female relative to the potential host female. Parasitic females are generally larger than their host counterparts, but on average, there is no size difference between the parasite and the host.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>
The American Coot, unlike other parasitized species, has the ability to recognize and reject conspecific parasitic chicks from their brood.<sup id="cite_ref-Shizuka_2009_223.E2.80.93226_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shizuka_2009_223.E2.80.93226-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Parents aggressively reject parasite chicks by pecking them vigorously, drowning them, preventing them from entering the nest, etc. They learn to recognize their own chicks by imprinting on cues from the first chick that hatches. The first-hatched chick is a reference to which parents discriminate between later-hatched chicks. Chicks that do not match the imprinted cues are then recognized as parasite chicks and are rejected.<sup id="cite_ref-Shizuka_2009_223.E2.80.93226_18-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shizuka_2009_223.E2.80.93226-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>
Chick recognition reduces the costs associated with parasitism, and Coots are one of only three bird species in which this behavior has evolved. This is because hatching order is predictable in parasitized Coots—host eggs will reliably hatch before parasite eggs. In other species where hatching order is not as reliable, there is a risk of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)" title="Imprinting (psychology)">misimprinting</a> on a parasite chick first and then rejecting their own chicks. In these species, the cost of accidentally misimprinting is greater than the benefits of rejecting parasite chicks.<sup id="cite_ref-Shizuka_2009_223.E2.80.93226_18-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shizuka_2009_223.E2.80.93226-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>
The first evidence for parental selection of exaggerated, ornamental traits in offspring was found in American Coots.<sup id="cite_ref-Lyon_1994_240.E2.80.93242_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lyon_1994_240.E2.80.93242-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Black American Coot chicks have conspicuously orange-tipped ornamental <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plume_(feather)" title="Plume (feather)">plumes</a> covering the front half of their body that are known as “chick ornaments” that eventually get bleached out after six days. This brightly colored, exaggerated trait makes Coot chicks more susceptible to predation and does not aid in thermoregulation, but remains selected for by parental choice. These plumes are not necessary for chick viability, but increased chick ornamentation increases the likelihood that a chick will be chosen as a favorite by the parents. Experimental manipulation of chick ornamentation by clipping the bright plumes have shown that parents show clear preferences for ornamented chicks over non-ornamented ones.<sup id="cite_ref-Lyon_1994_240.E2.80.93242_19-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lyon_1994_240.E2.80.93242-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup>
The American Coot is fairly aggressive in defense of its eggs and, in combination with their protected nesting habitat, this undoubtedly help reduce losses of eggs and young to all but most determined and effective predators. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Crow" title="American Crow">American Crows</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-billed_Magpie" title="Black-billed Magpie">Black-billed Magpies</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forster%27s_Tern" title="Forster's Tern">Forster's Tern</a> can sometime take eggs.

Conversely, the bold behavior of immature and adult coots leads to them falling prey with relative regularity once out of the breeding season.

On the Louisiana coast, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun" title="Cajun">Cajun</a> word for coot is <i><b>pouldeau</b></i>, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_(language)" title="French (language)" class="mw-redirect">French</a> for "coot", <i>poule d'eau</i> - literally "water hen".
