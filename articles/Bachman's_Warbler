<b>Bachman's Warbler</b>, <i>Vermivora bachmanii</i>, is (or was) a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> that inhabits the swamps and lowland forests of the southeast United States.

Bachman’s Warbler is small for a warbler and is unique for its thin and decurved bill. It has strong sexual dimorphism. Adult males are olive above and yellow below, with a black upper chest and forecrown giving them a distinctive look. Adult females have an olive-green back and a gray crown, while the underbelly is a light yellow. Immatures are a dull gray.

Bachman’s Warbler was originally collected by John Bachman in 1832 and described by Audubon in 1833.<sup id="cite_ref-Dunn121_2-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunn121-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> However, it remained largely unknown until the mid 1880s.<sup id="cite_ref-Dunn121_2-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunn121-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It is believed that selective logging in the 1800s briefly benefited the species by providing more habitat.<sup id="cite_ref-Dunn121_2-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunn121-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It was frequently seen in its breeding habitat from the mid 1880s to 1910.<sup id="cite_ref-Dunn121_2-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunn121-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> However, when clear-cutting began replacing selective logging, sightings of this species grew scarce.<sup id="cite_ref-Dunn121_2-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunn121-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> By the 1930s, sightings were rare, and in 1940 the last definite winter sighting was recorded.<sup id="cite_ref-Dunn122_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunn122-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The last male specimen was collected on March 21, 1941 on <a href="/w/index.php?title=Deer_Island,_Mississippi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Deer Island, Mississippi (page does not exist)">Deer Island, Mississippi</a>, while the last female specimen was collected on February 28, 1940 on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_Island,_Mississippi" title="Ship Island, Mississippi" class="mw-redirect">Ship Island, Mississippi</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Dunn122_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunn122-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Reports of birds from the Missouri and Arkansas breeding grounds lasted through the 1940s, while birds were reported breeding in South Carolina’s <a href="/w/index.php?title=I%E2%80%99on_Swamp&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="I’on Swamp (page does not exist)">I’on Swamp</a> until 1953.<sup id="cite_ref-Dunn122_3-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunn122-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Individuals were reported from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_County,_Virginia" title="Fairfax County, Virginia">Fairfax County, Virginia</a> in 1954 and 1958, and a male was seen singing near I’on Swamp in April 1962.<sup id="cite_ref-Dunn122_3-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunn122-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> On March 30, 1977 an immature female was seen in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brevard_County,_Florida" title="Brevard County, Florida">Brevard County, Florida</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Dunn122_3-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunn122-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>

Bachman's Warbler is possibly extinct, and was most likely never common. Bachman's Warbler's last stronghold was in I'on Swamp, South Carolina. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction">Habitat destruction</a> was probably the main cause of its disappearance. Its extinction is not yet officially announced, because habitat remaining in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congaree_National_Park" title="Congaree National Park">Congaree National Park</a> needs to be surveyed. Furthermore, on January 14, 2002, a bird reminiscent of a female Bachman's Warbler was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/bachman/mysterywarbler.html">filmed</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardalavaca" title="Guardalavaca">Guardalavaca</a>, Cuba. As <i>Vermivora</i> warblers are not known to live more than about 7 years, if the identification is correct it would imply that a breeding population managed to survive undiscovered for decades. The female warbler incubates her eggs while the father looks for food.
It is thought to have nested in <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cane_brake" class="extiw" title="wikt:cane brake">canebrakes</a>, the loss of which (along with that of wintering habitat in the Caribbean), and having once been hunted for its plumes all posed threats.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Small-scale logging in the 1800s may actually have increased Bachman Warbler’s breeding habitat.<sup id="cite_ref-Dunn120_8-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dunn120-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>
Audubon's folio renderings of a male and female Bachman's Warbler were painted on top of an illustration of the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklinia" title="Franklinia">Franklinia</a></i> tree first painted by Maria Martin, Bachman's sister-in-law and one of the country's first female natural history illustrators.

This death scene has been noted as a particularly memorable one in the history of comics.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
