The <b>Dusky Antbird</b> or <b>Tyrannine Antbird</b> (<i>Cercomacra tyrannina</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antbird" title="Antbird">antbird</a> family. It is a resident breeder in tropical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> from southeastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> southwards to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Basin" title="Amazon Basin">Amazonian</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>.
This is a common bird in the understory thickets of wet forest, especially at edges and clearings, and in adjacent tall second growth. The female lays two reddish-brown-spotted white eggs, which are incubated by both sexes, in a small, deep, plant fibre and dead leaf cup nest, which is suspended from the fork of a thin branch or vine low in a tree. The male and female parents both feed the chicks.
The Dusky Antbird is typically 14.5&nbsp;cm long, and weighs 18&nbsp;g. The adult male is mainly blackish-grey above and paler grey below, with two white wing bars. The female has brown upperparts and rufous-cinnamon underparts. Young birds, especially males, are darker than the adults. Exact plumage shades vary geographically, since there are a number of subspecies of this antbird.
This species has a whistled <i>kick</i> call, and the song is a duet, the male’s ascending whistle <i>pu pu pe pi pi</i> answered by the female’s softer, jerky <i>juu-ut juu-ut juu-ut juu-ut juu-ut</i> .
The Dusky Antbird is normally found as pairs throughout the year and does not join <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-species_feeding_flock" title="Mixed-species feeding flock" class="mw-redirect">mixed-species feeding flocks</a>. It feeds on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a> taken from twigs and foliage in thickets or vine tangles. It is easier to hear than see in its dense habitat.
