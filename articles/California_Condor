The plumage is black with patches of white on the underside of the wings and the head is largely bald, with skin color ranging from gray on young birds to yellow and bright orange on breeding adults. Its huge 3.0&nbsp;m (9.8&nbsp;ft) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingspan" title="Wingspan">wingspan</a> is the largest of any North American bird, and its weight of up to 12&nbsp;kg (26&nbsp;lb) makes it nearly equal the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpeter_Swan" title="Trumpeter Swan">Trumpeter Swan</a>, the largest among native North American bird species. The condor is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger" title="Scavenger">scavenger</a> and eats large amounts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion" title="Carrion">carrion</a>.

As an adaptation for hygiene, the condor's head and neck have few feathers, which exposes the skin to the sterilizing effects of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration" title="Dehydration">dehydration</a> and solar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_light" title="Ultraviolet light" class="mw-redirect">ultraviolet light</a> at high altitudes.

Contrary to the usual rule among true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">birds of prey</a>, the female is slightly smaller than the male. Overall length can range from 109 to 140 cm (43 to 55 in) and wingspan from 2.49 to 3 m (8.2 to 9.8 ft). Their weight can range from 7 to 14.1 kg (15 to 31 lb), with estimations of average weight ranging from 8 to 9 kg (18 to 20 lb).<sup id="cite_ref-BirdLife_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdLife-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Wingspans of up to 3.4&nbsp;m (11&nbsp;ft) have been reported but no wingspan over 3.05&nbsp;m (10.0&nbsp;ft) has been verified.<sup id="cite_ref-Wood_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wood-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> Most measurements are from birds raised in captivity, so determining if there are any major differences in measurements between wild and captive condors is difficult.

The middle toe of the California Condor's foot is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only slightly developed.

At the time of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">human settlement of the Americas</a>, the California Condor was widespread across North America.

When in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_flight" title="Bird flight">flight</a>, the movements of the condor are remarkably graceful. The lack of a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternum" title="Sternum">sternum</a> to anchor their correspondingly large flight muscles restricts them to being primarily soarers. The birds flap their wings when taking off from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation they largely glide, sometimes going for miles without a single flap of their wings. They have been known to fly up to speeds of 90&nbsp;km/h (55&nbsp;mph) and as high as 4,600 m (15,000&nbsp;ft).<sup id="cite_ref-USFW_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-USFW-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> They prefer to roost on high perches from which they can launch without any major wing-flapping effort.

Chicks are born with their eyes open and sometimes can take up to a week to leave the shell completely.<sup id="cite_ref-CoolFacts_17-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CoolFacts-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after five to six months, but continue to roost and forage with their parents until they are in their second year, at which point the parents typically turn their energies to a new nest.<sup id="cite_ref-Cornell_15-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cornell-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Raven" title="Common Raven">Ravens</a> are the main predatory threat to condor eggs, while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_eagle" title="Golden eagle" class="mw-redirect">golden eagles</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear" title="Bear">bears</a> are potential predators of condor offspring.
In modern times, a wide variety of causes have contributed to the condor's decline. Its low clutch size (one young per nest), combined with a late age of sexual maturity, make the bird vulnerable to artificial population decline. Significant damage to the condor population is also attributed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching" title="Poaching">poaching</a>, especially for museum specimens,<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning" title="Lead poisoning">lead poisoning</a> (from eating animals containing lead shot),<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">DDT</a> poisoning,<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission" title="Electric power transmission">electric power lines</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oology" title="Oology">egg collecting</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction">habitat destruction</a>. During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gold_Rush" title="California Gold Rush">California Gold Rush</a>, some condors were even kept as pets.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> The leading cause of mortality in nestling condors is the ingestion of trash that is fed to them by their parents.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup>
In addition to this, cattle ranchers who observed condors feeding on the dead young of their cattle assumed that the birds killed the cattle. This fallacy led to the condor's extinction in some parts of the western United States. This belief was so deeply ingrained that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reintroduction" title="Reintroduction">reintroduction</a> of condors to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon" title="Grand Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> was challenged by some cattle ranchers, who mistakenly believed that the bird hunted calves and lambs.<sup id="cite_ref-SheppardSoftware_45-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SheppardSoftware-45"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup>
Unanticipated deaths among recent condor populations occurred due to contact with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Eagle" title="Golden Eagle">Golden Eagles</a>, power lines, wind turbines and other factors such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning" title="Lead poisoning">lead poisoning</a>. Since 1994, captive-bred California Condors have been trained to avoid power lines and people. Since the implementation of this aversion conditioning program, the number of condor deaths due to power lines has greatly decreased.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup> Lead poisoning due to fragmented lead bullets in large game waste is a particularly big problem for condors due to their extremely strong digestive juices;<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> this lead waste is not as much of a problem for other avian scavengers such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_Vulture" title="Turkey Vulture">Turkey Vulture</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Raven" title="Common Raven">Common Raven</a>. This problem has been addressed in California by the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, a bill that went into effect July 1, 2008 that requires that hunters use non-lead bullets when hunting in the condor's range.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48"><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup> Blood lead levels in Golden Eagles as well as Turkey Vultures has declined with the implementation of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, demonstrating that the legislation has helped reduce other species' lead exposures aside from the California Condor.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49"><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup>
As the condor's population continued to decline, discussion began about starting a captive breeding program for the birds. Opponents to this plan argued that the condors had the right to freedom, that capturing all of the condors would change the species' habits forever, and that the cost was too great.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50"><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> However, the project received the approval of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="Federal government of the United States">United States government</a>, and the capture of the remaining wild condors was completed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Sunday" title="Easter Sunday" class="mw-redirect">Easter Sunday</a> 1987, when AC-9, the last wild condor, was captured.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51"><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup> There were only 22 condors in existence, all in captivity.
The goal of the California Condor Recovery Plan was to establish two geographically separate populations, one in California and the other in Arizona, each with 150 birds and at least 15 breeding pairs. As the Recovery Program works toward this goal the number of release sites has grown. There are three active release sites in California, one in Arizona and one in Baja California, Mexico.<sup id="cite_ref-USAToday_52-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-USAToday-52"><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup>
The captive breeding program, led by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Wild_Animal_Park" title="San Diego Wild Animal Park" class="mw-redirect">San Diego Wild Animal Park</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Zoo" title="Los Angeles Zoo">Los Angeles Zoo</a>, got off to a slow start due to the condor's mating habits. However, utilizing the bird's ability to double <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)" title="Clutch (eggs)">clutch</a>, biologists began removing the first egg from the nest and raising it with puppets, allowing the parents to lay another egg.
As the number of condors grew, attention began to focus on releasing some back into the wild. In 1988, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service" title="United States Fish and Wildlife Service">United States Fish and Wildlife Service</a> began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_Condor" title="Andean Condor">Andean Condors</a> into the wild in California. Only females were released, to eliminate the possibility of accidentally introducing a South American species into the United States. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean Condors were recaptured and re-released in South America.<sup id="cite_ref-USFW_32-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-USFW-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> California Condors were released in 1991 and 1992 in California, and again in 1996 in Arizona near the Grand Canyon.<sup id="cite_ref-BirdLife_16-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BirdLife-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> Though the birth rate remains low in the wild, their numbers are increasing steadily through regular releases of captive-reared adolescents.
The California Condor conservation project may be one of the most expensive species conservation projects in United States history,<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> costing over $35&nbsp;million, including $20&nbsp;million in federal and state funding, since World War II.<sup id="cite_ref-Frequently_Asked_Questions_54-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Frequently_Asked_Questions-54"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup> As of 2007 the annual cost for the condor conservation program was around $2.0 million per year.<sup id="cite_ref-Frequently_Asked_Questions_54-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Frequently_Asked_Questions-54"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup> However, nesting milestones have been recently reached by the reintroduced condors.
