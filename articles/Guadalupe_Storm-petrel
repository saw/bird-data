<i>Oceanodroma leucorhoa macrodactyla</i> <small>W.E. Bryant, 1887</small>
The <b>Guadalupe Storm Petrel</b> (<i>Oceanodroma macrodactyla</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> of the storm petrel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrobatidae" title="Hydrobatidae" class="mw-redirect">Hydrobatidae</a>. It is apparently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct" title="Extinct" class="mw-redirect">extinct</a>.
This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> was almost indistinguishable from its relative, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leach%27s_Storm_Petrel" title="Leach's Storm Petrel">Leach's Storm Petrel</a>. In the field, they could not be told apart except by their <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/circannual" class="extiw" title="wikt:circannual">circannual</a> rhythm. In the hand, the Guadalupe Storm Petrel could be distinguished by slightly larger size and the paler underwing coverts.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
It bred only on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalupe_Island" title="Guadalupe Island">Guadalupe Island</a> off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California" title="Baja California">Baja California</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>), and presumably ranged throughout the region. The breeding season was set between that of the local subspecies of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leach%27s_Storm_Petrel" title="Leach's Storm Petrel">Leach's Storm Petrel</a>, the winter-breeding <i>Oceanodroma leucorhoa cheimomnestes</i> and the summer-breeding <i>O. l. socorroensis</i>, in accordance with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gause%27s_Law" title="Gause's Law" class="mw-redirect">Gause's Law</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The single egg, white with a faint ring of reddish-brown and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_(color)" title="Lavender (color)">lavender</a> speckles around the blunt end, was laid in burrows maybe 15&nbsp;inches (35–40&nbsp;cm) long, below the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalupe_Pine" title="Guadalupe Pine" class="mw-redirect">Guadalupe Pine</a> (<i>Pinus radiata</i> var. <i>binata</i>)-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_Oak" title="Island Oak" class="mw-redirect">Island Oak</a> (<i>Quercus tomentella</i>)<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_forest" title="Cloud forest">cloud forest</a> on top of Mount Augusta. By mid-June, almost all young had already left the burrows. Though there is little data on <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanodroma" title="Oceanodroma">Oceanodroma</a></i> breeding, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation" title="Avian incubation" class="mw-redirect">incubation</a> was presumably 42 days or so in this species, just as in similar-sized relatives. Time to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledging" title="Fledging" class="mw-redirect">fledging</a> must have taken between 60 and 75(-85?) days, most likely around 65 days. This would mean that egg-laying took place from early February to March, and that in April–May, unfledged young were present in most active burrows. just as in their relatives, the egg was incubated a few days by either parent, after which the other took over, the relieved bird taking to the sea to satiate themselves for the next incubation stint. The young were fed only at night, also like in other storm-petrels.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
Three species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lice" title="Lice" class="mw-redirect">lice</a> were found to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite" title="Parasite" class="mw-redirect">parasitize</a> the Guadalupe Storm Petrel: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menoponidae" title="Menoponidae">menoponids</a> <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Longimenopon_dominicanum&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Longimenopon dominicanum (page does not exist)">Longimenopon dominicanum</a></i> and <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Austromenopon_oceanodromae&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Austromenopon oceanodromae (page does not exist)">Austromenopon oceanodromae</a></i>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischnocera" title="Ischnocera">ischnoceran</a> <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Halipeurus_raphanus&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Halipeurus raphanus (page does not exist)">Halipeurus raphanus</a></i>. The second also occurs on some other storm petrels, and the third was also found on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashy_Storm_Petrel" title="Ashy Storm Petrel">Ashy Storm Petrel</a>. <i>L. dominicanum</i> on the other hand has to date not been found on other birds and seems to be a case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coextinction" title="Coextinction">coextinction</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The introduction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" title="Cat">cats</a> to the island decimated the population during the late 19th century. By the end of the 1906 breeding season, it was still considered "abundant"<sup id="cite_ref-thayerbangs1908_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-thayerbangs1908-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> though of course the "large numbers" of birds present there and then must have been nearly the entire population of this species. Still, it was noted that
"[t]he mortality among these birds from the depredations of the cats that overrun the island is appalling - wings and feathers lie scattered in every direction around the burrows along the top of the pine ridge."<sup id="cite_ref-thayerbangs1908_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-thayerbangs1908-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
The last two specimens were supposedly collected between May 2 and May 5, 1911<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s) from October 2007">verification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> and the last record of a breeding bird was in 1912<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>. The species has not been seen since. Only old, abandoned burrows and the decayed remains of storm petrels killed by cats were found in the years thereafter. However, the Guadalupe Storm Petrel cannot be distinguished from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatric" title="Sympatric" class="mw-redirect">sympatric</a> <i>O. leucorhoa</i> in the field, and surveys on Guadalupe invariably took place outside the breeding season of <i>O. macrodactyla</i>, focussing on researching the local Leach's Storm Petrels. Thus, there remained some hope for the present species' survival, or rather, its extinction could not be definitely confirmed.
From June 4 to June 10, 2000, the Guadalupe Storm Petrel's breeding grounds were finally surveyed at the correct time. Had the species survived, not only would recently fledged immature birds have been present, but also all signs of a recently ended breeding season, such as eggshells and freshly used burrows retaining the musky smell of these birds. In the words of the expedition's primary researcher, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Exequiel_Ezcurra&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Exequiel Ezcurra (page does not exist)">Exequiel Ezcurra</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Natural_History_Museum" title="San Diego Natural History Museum">San Diego Natural History Museum</a>,
"We searched thoroughly for the Guadalupe Storm Petrel, and failed to find it. Sadly, we are now more ready to admit that the species is indeed extinct. Never, since the 1920s, had so much search effort been devoted to this species. At different times, more than 10 researchers looked for the elusive creature. It simply was not there."<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sdnhm.org/research/guadalupe/updates.html">[1]</a>
The official classification by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a> has not been updated yet. In any case, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle" title="Precautionary principle">precautionary principle</a> would probably require a few years of follow-up surveys, possible now that restoration of Guadalupe's ecosystem is underway.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from October 2009">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
