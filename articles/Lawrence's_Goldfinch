<i>Spinus lawrencei</i>
<b>Lawrence's Goldfinch</b>, <i>Carduelis lawrencei</i>, is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbird</a> of erratic distribution that breeds in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California" title="Baja California">Baja California</a> and winters in the southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.
At about 4.75&nbsp;inches (12&nbsp;cm) long and weighing about 0.4 oz (11.5&nbsp;g), it is slightly bigger than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Goldfinch" title="Lesser Goldfinch">Lesser Goldfinch</a> and slightly smaller than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Goldfinch" title="American Goldfinch">American Goldfinch</a>, with less yellow in the plumage than either. Adults of both sexes are gray with pink to grayish flesh-color bills, stubbier than other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfinch" title="Goldfinch">goldfinches</a>'. They have yellow rumps and paired yellowish wing-bars, as well as yellow edges on the flight feathers and yellow on the breast. The tail is black, crossed by a white band (Sibley 2000, Oiseaux.net 1996–2007). Plumage is duller in winter, brightening after a spring molt (Davis 2001, Oiseaux.net 1996–2007). Males are paler, with black caps and faces and larger areas of brighter yellow. Females are browner, have less and duller yellow, and lack the black (Sibley 2000, Oiseaux.net 1996–2007). Juveniles resemble females but are even duller and have faint streaks on the upperparts and especially the underparts. (Davis 2001, Oiseaux.net 1996–2007).
Calls include "a nasal <i>too-err</i>, also a sharp, high <i>PIti</i> and <i>Itititi</i>" (Sibley 2000). The flight call, which is diagnostic, is given as "a high, clear <i>ti-too</i>" (Sibley 2000) or <i>tink-ul</i> "reminiscent of glass wind-chimes" (Davis 2001). The song is high-pitched, continuous, and limited in frequency range, including wind-chime notes and especially imitations of other species' calls and other simple and distinctive sounds (Sibley 2000, Davis 2001). Males sing in winter but mostly in the breeding season. Females sing occasionally and briefly (Davis 2001).
Lawrence's Goldfinch is known for its wandering habits. It breeds from about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shasta_County" title="Shasta County" class="mw-redirect">Shasta County</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California" title="Baja California">Baja California</a>, largely in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Ranges" title="Pacific Coast Ranges">Coast Ranges</a> and the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and in the Baja highlands, but also sometimes as far down as the coast; its highest breeding altitude is about 8,800 feet (2,680&nbsp;m) on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pinos" title="Mount Pinos">Mount Pinos</a>. There are only a few places where it has been observed to nest annually, notably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel_Valley" title="Carmel Valley">Carmel Valley</a> and the South Fork <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kern_River" title="Kern River">Kern River</a>. Choice of areas in its breeding range may depend on climate through the availability of water and preferred foods. Movements to the coast and upslope in the Sierras occur in drought years and movements to the edges of the range and into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Central_Valley" title="California Central Valley" class="mw-redirect">Central Valley</a> after wet years, possibly because of an increased food supply. It has bred a few times in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> (Davis 2001).
Most, but not always all, birds leave northern, central, and inland southern California in winter. They move into the coastal lowlands and into the lower parts of the southeastern California deserts, ranging irregularly (sometimes in large numbers) southeastward to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora" title="Sonora">Sonora</a> and northwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua_(state)" title="Chihuahua (state)">Chihuahua</a> and eastward to the southern half of Arizona, southwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>, and even the area of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas" title="El Paso, Texas">El Paso, Texas</a> (Davis 2001)—roughly the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrean_sky_islands" title="Madrean sky islands" class="mw-redirect">Madrean sky islands</a> region. In some winters mysteriously few birds are observed; possibly the birds are in Sonora and Chihuahua, which are poorly covered by naturalists. The greatest eastward irruptions often occur in wet periods and are synchronized with irruptions of other seedeating birds such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-breasted_Nuthatch" title="Red-breasted Nuthatch">Red-breasted Nuthatch</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Crossbill" title="Red Crossbill" class="mw-redirect">Red Crossbill</a>, and the other North American goldfinches (Davis 2001).
The typical nesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a> is dry and open woods that are near both brushy areas and fields of tall <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant" title="Annual plant">annual</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weed" title="Weed">weeds</a>, usually within half a mile (0.8&nbsp;km) of a small body of water. It may nest in other habitats, including rural residential areas, but not in deserts or dense forests. Outside the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesting_season" title="Nesting season">nesting season</a> it occurs in many open habitats including deserts, suburbs, and city parks (Davis 2001).
Lawrence's Goldfinch feeds almost entirely on seeds of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub" title="Shrub">shrubs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forb" title="Forb">forbs</a>. During the nesting season, it eats seeds of annuals, strongly favoring the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Fiddleneck" title="Common Fiddleneck" class="mw-redirect">Common Fiddleneck</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birding" title="Birding" class="mw-redirect">Birders</a> seeking Lawrence's Goldfinch are advised to know this plant. At other seasons in California, it predominantly eats <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamise" title="Chamise" class="mw-redirect">Chamise</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achene" title="Achene">achenes</a> and also berries of mistletoe (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoradendron" title="Phoradendron">Phoradendron</a></i>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamnus_californica" title="Rhamnus californica">California Buckthorn</a>. In Arizona, it often eats the seeds of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus" title="Amaranthus" class="mw-redirect">amaranths</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suaeda_nigra" title="Suaeda nigra">Inkweed</a> (Davis 2001, 1999). It is attracted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guizotia_abyssinica" title="Guizotia abyssinica">niger</a> seed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_feeding" title="Bird feeding">feeders</a>.
The nesting season is early spring to early summer, or sometimes as late as late July. As in other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carduelinae" title="Carduelinae">cardueline finches</a>, pairs form in large pre-breeding flocks. Pairs leave the flocks and search for nest sites, the female taking the lead, often carrying nesting material and making building motions. The male follows, singing and calling. Nest sites may be in any of a number of trees, but early in the season they are often in mistletoe or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_sycamore" title="Western sycamore" class="mw-redirect">Western sycamore</a>, while later they are in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_oak" title="Live oak">live oaks</a> and especially the deciduous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Oak" title="Blue Oak" class="mw-redirect">Blue Oak</a> (Davis 2001, citing Coutlee 1968a).
Nests are usually single but sometimes in loose colonies that may contain over 10 pairs. The female builds the nest while the male follows her on long material-gathering forays or sings from a perch. It is a loosely woven cup in a fork of several small branches, placed about 10 feet (3&nbsp;m) up near the edge of the tree. There are three to six eggs, unmarked white with a blue or green tinge (Davis 2001).
The female incubates for 12 to 13 days and broods the chicks for four or five days, staying almost constantly on the nest; the male brings food. After the fourth day, the female joins the male in food-gathering trips but still broods at times through the seventh day. The chicks fledge at about 13 or 14 days, and after another 5 to 7 days leave the family to join a pre-migratory flock (Davis 2001).
During the breeding season, males join to form small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flock_(birds)" title="Flock (birds)">flocks</a> while females are on the nest. At other times, birds are found in flocks that typically comprise under 50 individuals but are occasionally over 500. Flocks may <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-species_feeding_flock" title="Mixed-species feeding flock" class="mw-redirect">mix</a> with other small seed-eating species.
This species is remarkably homogeneous, with no subspecies, and according to one study, no genetic variation at the 23 loci tested (Davis 2001, citing Marten and Johnson 1986).
This bird's name commemorates the American ornithologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Newbold_Lawrence" title="George Newbold Lawrence">George Newbold Lawrence</a>.
