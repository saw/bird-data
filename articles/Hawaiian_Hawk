The <b>Hawaiian Hawk</b> or <i><b><span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Io</b></i> (<i>Buteo solitarius</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey" title="Bird of prey">raptor</a> of the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteo" title="Buteo">Buteo</a></i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism" title="Endemism">endemic</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawai<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i</a>. Buteos tend to be easily recognized by their bulky bodies relative to their overall length and wingspan. The <i><span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Io</i> is the only hawk that is native to Hawai<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil" title="Fossil">fossil</a> evidence indicates that it inhabited the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_(island)" title="Hawaii (island)">island of Hawai<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molokai" title="Molokai">Moloka<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oahu" title="Oahu">O<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ahu</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauai" title="Kauai">Kaua<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i</a> at one time.<sup id="cite_ref-FactSheet_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FactSheet-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Today, it is known to breed only on the Big Island in stands of native <i><span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ōhi<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>a lehua</i> (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrosideros_polymorpha" title="Metrosideros polymorpha">Metrosideros polymorpha</a></i>) trees. The species is protected as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act" title="Endangered Species Act">endangered species</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. However, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">IUCN</a> classifies the species as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Threatened" title="Near Threatened">Near Threatened</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN2012_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN2012-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Hawaiian Hawk measures approximately 40 to 46 centimetres (16 to 18 in) in length. The female, which weighs 605&nbsp;g (21.3&nbsp;oz) on average, is larger than the male, which averages 441&nbsp;g (15.6&nbsp;oz).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Two color phases exist: a dark phase (dark brown head, breast, and underwings), and a light color phase (dark head, light breast and light underwings). Feet and legs are yellowish in adults and greenish in juveniles.
The adaptation of the Hawaiian hawk is that their body colors blend within trees and plants, and they have big talons to catch fish.
Common threats to the <i><span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Io</i> are illegal shootings, the degradation of their native forest habitat, poisoning, vehicle collisions, starvation, and predation from other animals.
This solitary hawk remains in and defends its territories year round. They nest from March through September, and usually lay only one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">egg</a> but sometimes they could lay up to three in their clutch. The female does the majority of sitting during the 38 days of incubation, while the male does the majority of the hunting. After the egg is hatched, the female only allows the male to visit when delivering food to the nest. The chick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledges</a> at seven or eight weeks. Fifty to seventy percent of the nests successfully fledge young.
The <i><span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Io</i> usually hunts from a stationary position, but can also dive on prey from the air. It feeds on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a>, small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a>, stream animals, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket" title="Cricket">crickets</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis" title="Mantis">praying mantises</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millipede" title="Millipede">millipedes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede" title="Centipede">centipedes</a>, and occasionally worms. It will also feed on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Crow" title="Hawaiian Crow">Hawaiian Crow</a>, a Hawaiian bird which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_in_the_wild" title="Extinct in the wild" class="mw-redirect">extinct in the wild</a>. They are opportunistic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator" class="mw-redirect">predators</a> and are versatile in their feeding habits. They have a shrill and high-pitched call much like their Hawaiian name: "eeeh-oh." They are very noisy during the breeding season. <i><span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Io</i> are strong fliers.
The Hawaiian hawk was a royal symbol in Hawaiian legend, and it is sometimes called “<i><span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Iolani</i>,” or “Exalted Hawk”, which was the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamehameha_IV" title="Kamehameha IV">Kamehameha IV</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iolani_Palace" title="Iolani Palace" class="mw-redirect"><span class="unicode">ʻ</span>Iolani Palace</a>.
