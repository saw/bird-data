<i>Parus gambeli</i>
The <b>Mountain Chickadee</b> (<i>Poecile gambeli</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird" title="Songbird">songbird</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">bird</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_(bird)" title="Tit (bird)">tit</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> Paridae. Often, it is still placed in the genus <i>Parus</i> with most other tits, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MtDNA" title="MtDNA" class="mw-redirect">mtDNA</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_b" title="Cytochrome b">cytochrome <i>b</i></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequence" title="DNA sequence" class="mw-redirect">sequence</a> data and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphology</a> suggest that separating <i>Poecile</i> more adequately expresses these birds' relationships (Gill <i>et al.</i>, 2005). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ornithologists%27_Union" title="American Ornithologists' Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> has been treating <i>Poecile</i> as a distinct genus for some time.
Adults of both sexes have a black cap joining a black postocular stripe behind distinctive white eyebrows. Their backs and flanks are gray and they have paler gray underparts; they have a short black bill, and a black bib. The typical adult wingspan is 7.5&nbsp;inches (19&nbsp;cm), and the overall length is 5-6&nbsp;inches (14&nbsp;cm).
Common inhabitants of the mountainous regions of the western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, their range extends from the southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon" title="Yukon">Yukon</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> and Rocky Mountain States in the United States. A few Mountain Chickadees may migrate locally up the mountains in the summer and down into the mountain foothills in the winter; but this phenomenon is not well documented. In the Santa Fe Valley of the southern Rocky Mountains, in New Mexico, they can be found about 300 feet above town, at 7,300 feet, as well at the base of the tallest mountains, Tesuque and Baldy at 10,400 feet; that mountain base is located 25 minutes up the one mountain road from the valley.
They breed monogamously, producing 1 to 2 broods per year. Incubation by the female is 14 days. The young are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" title="Altricial">altricial</a>, and stay in the nest for 21 days while being fed by both parents.
Their primary diet is insects during the summer and breeding season; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer" title="Conifer" class="mw-redirect">conifer</a> seeds and other plant seeds are taken throughout the year. They cling to the undersides of branches and to tree trunks, searching for food in the bark or breaking seeds open by hammering them with their beaks.
Their call is a throaty <i>chick-adee-dee-dee</i>, while their song is a 3- or 4-note descending whistle <i>fee-bee-bay</i> or <i>fee-bee-fee-bee</i>. They travel in pairs or small groups, and may join <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_species_feeding_flock" title="Mixed species feeding flock" class="mw-redirect">multi-species feeding flocks</a> after breeding season.
Recent studies have indicated that in mixed flocks, Black-Capped Chickadees become dominant over Mountain Chickadees.
