The <b>Socorro Mockingbird</b> (<i>Mimus graysoni</i>) is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species" title="Endangered species">endangered</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockingbird" title="Mockingbird">mockingbird</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)" title="Endemic (ecology)" class="mw-redirect">endemic</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socorro_Island" title="Socorro Island">Socorro Island</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revillagigedo_Islands" title="Revillagigedo Islands">Revillagigedo Islands</a>.

<i>Mimus graysoni</i> shows its close relationship to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mockingbird" title="Northern Mockingbird">Northern</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Mockingbird" title="Tropical Mockingbird">Tropical Mockingbirds</a> rather subtly. It is a much stouter bird, resembling some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrasher" title="Thrasher">thrashers</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">habitus</a>. It also has a distinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_(organism)" title="Juvenile (organism)">juvenile</a> plumage, more rufous above and with heavy pattern, especially below. This uncannily resembles, e.g., the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_Thrasher" title="Gray Thrasher">Gray Thrasher</a> (<i>Toxostoma cinereum</i>) from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California" title="Baja California">Baja California</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-b.26h1953_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-b.26h1953-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> but is apparently a case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution" title="Convergent evolution">convergent evolution</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-barberetal2004_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-barberetal2004-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
This is a rather distinct <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimus" title="Mimus">Mimus</a></i> mockingbird and was for some time placed into a distinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a>, <i><b>Mimodes</b></i>. This was revealed to be incorrect based on analysis of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MtDNA" title="MtDNA" class="mw-redirect">mtDNA</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NADH_dehydrogenase" title="NADH dehydrogenase">NADH dehydrogenase</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit" title="Protein subunit">subunit</a> 2 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequence" title="DNA sequence" class="mw-redirect">sequences</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-barberetal2004_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-barberetal2004-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
Rather, the present species is closely related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mockingbird" title="Northern Mockingbird">Northern</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Mockingbird" title="Tropical Mockingbird">Tropical Mockingbirds</a>. Its distinctiveness is the result of the strong <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection" title="Natural selection">selective</a> pressure on its island home, which enforced the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolution</a> of conspicuous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(biology)" title="Adaptation (biology)" class="mw-redirect">adaptational</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autapomorph" title="Autapomorph" class="mw-redirect">autapomorphies</a>. The juvenile plumage might also have been the result of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift" title="Genetic drift">genetic drift</a> enforced maybe by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_partitioning" title="Resource partitioning" class="mw-redirect">resource partitioning</a> in this aggressive bird. The standard model of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock" title="Molecular clock">molecular clocks</a> (which in any case is fundamentally flawed) cannot be applied for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimid" title="Mimid">mimids</a> as their rates of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation" title="Mutation">mutation</a> seem to vary much over time.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> While it is the most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypical" title="Phenotypical" class="mw-redirect">phenotypically</a> distinctive bird on Socorro, it also has the strongest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological" title="Ecological" class="mw-redirect">ecological</a> change from its ancestors; therefore its distinctiveness is not informative except supporting the theory that it is one of the older Socorro endemics.<sup id="cite_ref-b.26h1953_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-b.26h1953-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Thus, and because the adaptation to the peculiar conditions on Socorro may even have accelerated not only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" title="Morphology (biology)">morphological</a> but also molecular evolution - see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect" title="Founder effect">founder effect</a> -, it cannot be said with any certainty whether or not among <i>Mimus</i>, the Socorro species is a quite recent island offshoot of either of the mainland species. In any case, the three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxa" title="Taxa" class="mw-redirect">taxa</a> are very close relatives. This serves to show that evolution does not move on at a constant speed; certainly not on a morphological level, and often neither on a molecular level either. Rather, the rate of evolutionary change varies, sometimes considerably, depending on the circumstances and the strength with which natural selection acts upon a founding population.
The Socorro Mockingbird today lives mainly in unmodified low <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forest</a> above 600&nbsp;m, where it prefers groves of <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Oreopanax_xalapensis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Oreopanax xalapensis (page does not exist)">Oreopanax xalapensis</a></i> and the endemic <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Guettarda_insularis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Guettarda insularis (page does not exist)">Guettarda insularis</a></i>, with an understorey dominated by <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Triumfetta_socorrensis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Triumfetta socorrensis (page does not exist)">Triumfetta socorrensis</a></i> and the endemic <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Eupatorium_pacificum&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Eupatorium pacificum (page does not exist)">Eupatorium pacificum</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-iucn_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iucn-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> As late as March 1953 it was still "common" at lower elevations, foraging in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arid" title="Arid">arid</a> open areas of the <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Croton_masonii&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Croton masonii (page does not exist)">Croton masonii</a></i>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia" title="Opuntia">prickly pear</a><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrubland" title="Shrubland">shrubland</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-b.26h1953_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-b.26h1953-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> In November of the same year, the birds had retired to the more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid" title="Humid" class="mw-redirect">humid</a> forest in the uplands and were busy singing and defending territories.<sup id="cite_ref-b.26h1953_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-b.26h1953-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Today, they mainly remain in <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Ficus_cotinifolia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ficus cotinifolia (page does not exist)">Ficus cotinifolia</a></i> stands when visiting the lower elevations.<sup id="cite_ref-iucn_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iucn-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The breeding season is extended, with nests in attendance between November and July, with the peak laying occurring in March and April.<sup id="cite_ref-iucn_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iucn-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Three eggs are laid, which take no more 15 days to hatch.<sup id="cite_ref-iucn_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iucn-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
The birds are generally reluctant to fly and as late as the mid-20th century were still fatally unwary; if pressed they will rather hop away than fly and if they take wing, it is usually for a few meters only.<sup id="cite_ref-b.26h1953_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-b.26h1953-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> This may be an adaptation to the fact that Socorro has no native <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_animal" title="Terrestrial animal">terrestrial</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator" class="mw-redirect">predators</a>, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Hawk" title="Red-tailed Hawk">Red-tailed Hawks</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Frigatebird" title="Great Frigatebird">Great Frigatebirds</a> that not infrequently prey on mockingbird-sized birds.
This species feeds on small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate" title="Invertebrate">invertebrates</a>, the remains of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_crab" title="Land crab" class="mw-redirect">land crabs</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> and fruit, namely of the endemic shrubs <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Ilex_socorrensis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ilex socorrensis (page does not exist)">Ilex socorrensis</a></i> and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideroxylon_socorrense" title="Sideroxylon socorrense">Sideroxylon socorrense</a></i>, the latter of which has also become rare.<sup id="cite_ref-iucn_5-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iucn-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Flies are pecked up but do not seem to be snatched out of the air.<sup id="cite_ref-b.26h1953_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-b.26h1953-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Like many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimidae" title="Mimidae" class="mw-redirect">Mimidae</a>, the Socorro Mockingbird is an aggressive, solitary species living alone or with its partner. When they come together at a plentiful food source - e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowflies" title="Blowflies" class="mw-redirect">blowflies</a> on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion" title="Carrion">carcass</a> - there is a marked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_hierarchy" title="Social hierarchy" class="mw-redirect">social hierarchy</a> between birds and rarely are more than two or three actively feeding; the less dominant birds hang around nearby, waiting for their turn.<sup id="cite_ref-b.26h1953_2-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-b.26h1953-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
The call is two medium followed by one lower whistle. Less often, a full song is given, consisting of a variable warbling tune, repeated several times as in many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockingbird" title="Mockingbird">mockingbirds</a>. It is not clear whether this species imitates other birds like its relatives do; in any case only the Socorro <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Parula" title="Tropical Parula">Tropical Parula</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socorro_Towhee" title="Socorro Towhee" class="mw-redirect">Socorro Towhee</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socorro_Wren" title="Socorro Wren">Socorro Wren</a> would seem to possess songs that might serve as models for the mockingbirds, and except the parula these are not often found in the mockingbird's core <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-b.26h1953_2-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-b.26h1953-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
This species presently numbers fewer than 400 individuals altogether and is considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_Endangered" title="Critically Endangered">Critically Endangered</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>. <i>Mimus graysoni</i> is mostly threatened by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_loss" title="Habitat loss" class="mw-redirect">habitat loss</a> caused by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral" title="Feral">feral</a> sheep and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust" title="Locust">locust</a> <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Schistocerca_piceifrons&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Schistocerca piceifrons (page does not exist)">Schistocerca piceifrons</a></i>, and predation by feral <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" title="Cat">cats</a> which became established after 1953, probably in the early 1970s. It is not believed that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mockingbird" title="Northern Mockingbird">Northern Mockingbird</a> which has colonized Socorro in the late 20th century is limiting the recovery of its relative; the two <i>Mimus</i> do not occupy the same habitat and even if they did, the native bird is larger and more powerful and would probably simply outcompete its mainland relative in native vegetation at least. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_restoration" title="Island restoration">extermination</a> of the sheep is underway in the hope of restoring the island ecosystem.<sup id="cite_ref-iucn_5-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iucn-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
On one hand, it seems that the Socorro Mockingbird is a prolific species and would be able to increase in numbers quickly if habitat improves. On the other hand, its terrestrial habits make it vulnerable to cat predation and this may limit its recovery even if sheep are contained; it is not known for example in how far foraging in the lowlands – now cat-ridden – was important for robust breeding success. In addition, it can be expected that predation on this species by both the native Red-tailed Hawk as well as the feral cats has increased since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socorro_Dove" title="Socorro Dove">Socorro Dove</a> – formerly a preferred prey item – has become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_in_the_wild" title="Extinct in the wild" class="mw-redirect">extinct in the wild</a>.

This threat is presently not considered significant compared to the problem of introduced species however.<sup id="cite_ref-iucn_5-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iucn-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
