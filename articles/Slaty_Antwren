This is a common bird in the understory of wet forest and in adjacent tall second growth in foothills typically from 700 m to 1700 m altitude, although locally it may be found down to sea level or up to 2000 m. The female lays two red-brown spotted white eggs, which are incubated by both sexes, in a deep pouch nest constructed from plant fibres. The nest is suspended from the fork of a thin twig less than 2 m up. The male and female parents both feed the chicks.
The Slaty Antwren is typically 10&nbsp;cm long, and weighs 9.5 g. The adult male is mainly dark slate with a black throat and breast, black wings with white spots, and a concealed white shoulder patch. The white on the wings is less extensive than in related species. The adult female is olive-brown above and buff-brown below, paler on the throat. Young males are darker, duller and greyer than the adult female. This species has a thin <i>cheeur</i> call, and the infrequent song is a soft <i>t’week t’week t’week t’week weet weet weet weet</i> .
The Slaty Antwren is normally found as pairs, and often joins a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-species_feeding_flock" title="Mixed-species feeding flock" class="mw-redirect">mixed-species feeding flock</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodcreeper" title="Woodcreeper">woodcreepers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-crowned_Ant-Tanager" title="Red-crowned Ant-Tanager" class="mw-redirect">Red-crowned Ant-Tanagers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovenbird" title="Ovenbird">ovenbirds</a> and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basileuterus" title="Basileuterus">Basileuterus</a></i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_warbler" title="New World warbler">warblers</a>.
