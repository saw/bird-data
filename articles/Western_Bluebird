The <b>Western Bluebird</b> (<i>Sialia mexicana</i>) is a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_(bird)" title="Thrush (bird)">thrush</a>, approximately 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;in) to 18&nbsp;cm (7.1&nbsp;in) in length.
Adult males are bright blue on top and on the throat with an orange breast and sides, a brownish patch on back, and a gray belly and undertail coverts. Adult females have a duller blue body, wings, and tail than the male, a gray throat, dull orange breast, and a gray belly and undertail coverts. Immature Western Bluebirds have duller colors than the adults, they also have spots on their chest and back.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
They are sometimes confused with other bluebirds, however they can be distinguished without difficulty. The Western Bluebird has a blue (male) or gray (female) throat, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bluebird" title="Eastern Bluebird">Eastern Bluebird</a> has an orange throat, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Bluebird" title="Mountain Bluebird">Mountain Bluebird</a> lacks orange color anywhere on its body.
Western Bluebird breeding habitat is semi-open country, excluding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert" title="Desert">desert</a> areas. The year round range includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S." title="U.S." class="mw-redirect">U.S.</a>, and as far south as the states of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca" title="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz" title="Veracruz">Veracruz</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. The summer breeding range extends as far north as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest" title="Pacific Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana" title="Montana">Montana</a>. Northern birds can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migrate</a> to the southern parts of the range; southern birds are often permanent residents.
They nest in cavities or in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest_box" title="Nest box">nest boxes</a>, competing with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_Swallow" title="Tree Swallow">Tree Swallows</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Sparrow" title="House Sparrow">House Sparrows</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Starling" title="European Starling" class="mw-redirect">European Starlings</a> for natural nesting locations. Because of the high level of competition, House sparrows often attack Western Bluebirds for their nests. The attacks are made both in groups or alone. Attacks by Starlings can be reduced if the nesting box opening is kept to 1 1/2" to avoid takeover.
In restored forests Western Bluebirds have a higher probability of successfully fledging young than in untreated forests, but they are at greater risk of parasitic infestations. The effects on post-fledging survival are unknown.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Western Bluebirds have been found to enjoy more success with nest boxes than in natural cavities. They started egg laying earlier, had higher nesting success, lower predation rates, and fledged more young in boxes than in cavities but they did not have larger clutches of eggs.
The eggs are commonly 2-8 which average 20.8 x 16.2mm. Eggs are oval shape with a smooth and glossy shell. They are pale blue to bluish white and sometimes white in color. Nestlings remain in a nest about 19â€“22 days before fledging.
In a good year, the parents can rear two broods; with four to six eggs per clutch. According to genetic studies, 45% of Western Bluebirds' nests carried young that were not offspring of the male partner. In addition, Western Bluebirds will help their parents raise a new brood after their own nest fails. Western Bluebirds are also helped by other birds belonging to a different species altogether.
These birds wait on a perch and fly down to catch insects, sometimes catching them in midair. They mainly eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berries" title="Berries" class="mw-redirect">berries</a>. During the breeding season, Bluebirds are very helpful with pest control in the territory surrounding the nest.
