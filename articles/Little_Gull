As is the case with many gulls, it has traditionally been placed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larus" title="Larus">Larus</a></i>.

This species breeds colonially on freshwater marshes, making a lined nest on the ground amongst vegetation. Normally, 2-6 eggs are laid.
This is the smallest gull species, with a length of 25–30 cm (9.8–12 in), a wingspan of 61–78 cm (24–31 in) and a weight of 68–162 g (2.4–5.7 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-CRC_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRC-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> It is pale grey in breeding plumage with a black hood, dark underwings and often a pinkish flush on the breast. In winter, the head goes white apart from a darker cap and eye-spot. The bill is thin and black and the legs dark red. The flight on rounded wings is somewhat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern" title="Tern">tern-like</a>.
Young birds have black markings on the head and upperparts, and "W" pattern across the wings. They take three years to reach maturity.
These gulls pick food off the water surface, and will also catch insects in the air like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Tern" title="Black Tern">Black Tern</a>.
