Despite this wide range, numbers of the Clapper Rail are now very low on the United States' west coast, because of destruction of the coastal marshland habitat. The largest population of the western subspecies, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Clapper_Rail" title="California Clapper Rail">California Clapper Rail</a>, <i>R. l. obsoletus</i>, numbering somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500 birds,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay" title="San Francisco Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>; there is a small inland population along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River_(U.S.)" title="Colorado River (U.S.)" class="mw-redirect">Colorado River</a>.

The Clapper Rail is a chicken-sized bird that rarely flies. It is grayish brown with a pale chestnut breast and a noticeable white patch under the tail. Its bill curves slightly downwards. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidadian</a> subspecies <i>R. l. pelodromus</i> is more heavily marked with black above.

They search for food while walking, sometimes probing with their long bills, in shallow water or mud.
The twig nest is placed low in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove" title="Mangrove">mangrove</a> roots, and 3-7 purple-spotted buff eggs are laid.
