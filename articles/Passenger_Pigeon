The Passenger Pigeon was larger than a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mourning_Dove" title="Mourning Dove">Mourning Dove</a> and had a body size similar to a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Pigeon" title="Rock Pigeon" class="mw-redirect">Rock Pigeon</a>.

The male had black streaks on the scapulars and wing coverts and patches of pinkish iridescence at the sides of the neck changed in color to a shining metallic bronze, green, and purple at the back of the neck in various lights. Female and immature birds were similarly marked, but with duller gray on the back, a lighter rose breast and much less iridescent necks.<sup id="cite_ref-SI_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SI-25"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> The wings were long and broad.<sup id="cite_ref-Extinct_Birds_18-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Extinct_Birds-18"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The tail was extremely long at 20–23&nbsp;cm (8–9&nbsp;in) and gray to blackish with a white edge.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>
The Passenger Pigeon was a very social bird. It lived in colonies stretching over hundreds of square miles, practicing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_breeding" title="Communal breeding" class="mw-redirect">communal breeding</a> with up to a hundred nests in a single tree. It may have been the most numerous bird on earth in its heyday, and A. W. Schorger believed it accounted for between 25 and 40% of the total landbird population in the US.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> Pigeon migration, in flocks numbering billions, was a spectacle without parallel,<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> as described by John James Audubon:
I dismounted, seated myself on an eminence, and began to mark with my pencil, making a dot for every flock that passed. In a short time finding the task which I had, undertaken impracticable, as the birds poured in in countless multitudes, I rose, and counting the dots then put down, found that 163 had been made in twenty-one minutes. I traveled on, and still met more the farther I proceeded. The air was literally filled with Pigeons; the light of noon-day was obscured as by an eclipse, the dung fell in spots, not unlike melting flakes of snow; and the continued buzz of wings had a tendency to lull my senses to repose... Before sunset I reached Louisville, distance from Hardensburgh fifty-five miles. The Pigeons were still passing in undiminished numbers, and continued to do so for three days in succession.
Their survival was thought to be based on the benefits of very large numbers.<sup id="cite_ref-Wisconsin_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wisconsin-29"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> There was safety in large flocks, which often numbered hundreds of thousands of birds. When a flock of this huge size established itself in an area, the number of local animal predators (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf" title="Gray wolf">wolves</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxes" title="Foxes" class="mw-redirect">foxes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasels" title="Weasels" class="mw-redirect">weasels</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawks" title="Hawks" class="mw-redirect">hawks</a>) was so small compared to the total number of birds, little damage would be inflicted on the flock as a whole. It was common for birds in flocks to perch on each other's backs, an unusual behavior even for socially inclined birds.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from November 2012">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
The bird is believed to have played a large ecological role in the presettlement forests of North America through tree breakage and depositing of excrement, thereby influencing the distribution of certain tree types.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup>
The mainstays of the passenger pigeon's diet were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beech" title="Beech">beechnuts</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn" title="Acorn">acorns</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut" title="Chestnut">chestnuts</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berries" title="Berries" class="mw-redirect">berries</a> found in the forests. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm" title="Worm">Worms</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> supplemented the diet in spring and summer. The pigeon was able to disgorge food from its crop when more desirable food became available.<sup id="cite_ref-Fuller_Extinct_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fuller_Extinct-31"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup>
The communal nesting sites were established in forest areas with a sufficient supply of food and water available within daily flying range. A single site might cover many thousands of acres, and the birds were so congested in these areas, hundreds of nests could be counted in a single tree. Since no accurate data were recorded, it is only possible to give estimates on the size and population of these nesting areas. One large nesting area in Wisconsin was reported as covering 850&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi (2,200&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), and the number of birds nesting there was estimated to be around 136,000,000.<sup id="cite_ref-WCHF_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WCHF-32"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> Breeding took place from March to September, mainly between April and May.<sup id="cite_ref-Extinct_Birds_18-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Extinct_Birds-18"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
John James Audubon described the courtship of the passenger pigeon as:
The male assumes a pompous demeanor, and follows the female, whether on the ground or on the branches, with spread tail and drooping wings, which it rubs against the part over which it is moving. The body is elevated, the throat swells, the eyes sparkle. He continues his notes, and now and then rises on the wing, and flies a few yards to approach the fugitive and timorous female. Like the domestic Pigeon and other species, they caress each other by billing, in which action, the bill of the one is introduced transversely into that of the other, and both parties alternately disgorge the contents of their crop by repeated efforts.<sup id="cite_ref-Audubon_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Audubon-33"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup>
Unlike the behaviour described by Audubon, captive specimens did not perform the bowing, strutting, and billing of other pigeons.<sup id="cite_ref-Extinct_Birds_18-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Extinct_Birds-18"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The nests were loosely constructed of small sticks and twigs, and were about a foot in diameter. A single, white, elongated egg was laid per nesting. The incubation period was from 12 to 14 days. Both parents shared the duties of incubating the egg and feeding the young. The young bird was naked and blind when born, but grew and developed rapidly. When feathered, it was similar in color to the adult female, but its feathers were tipped with white, giving it a scaled appearance. It remained in the nest about 14 days, being fed and cared for by the parent birds. By this time, it had grown large and plump and usually weighed more than either of its parents. It had developed enough to take care of itself and soon fluttered to the ground to hunt for its food.<sup id="cite_ref-SI_25-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SI-25"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup>
The time of the spring migration depended on weather conditions. Small flocks sometimes arrived in the northern nesting areas as early as February, but the main migration occurred in March and April. The flocks would travel massive distances, and might not return to a particular location "for decades". Traveling for hours at 60 miles per hour meant vast ranges could be covered.<sup id="cite_ref-sullivan_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sullivan-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> During summer, Passenger Pigeons lived in forest habitats throughout North America east of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> from eastern and central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States" title="Northeastern United States">northeastern United States</a>.

The extinction of the Passenger Pigeon has two major causes: commercial exploitation of pigeon meat on a massive scale<sup id="cite_ref-SI_25-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SI-25"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> and loss of habitat.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup>
Large flocks and communal breeding made the species highly vulnerable to hunting.<sup id="cite_ref-SI_25-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SI-25"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> As the flocks dwindled in size, populations decreased below the threshold necessary to propagate the species.<sup id="cite_ref-Extinction_36-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Extinction-36"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> Naturalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Ehrlich" title="Paul R.

Prior to colonization, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">aboriginal Americans</a> occasionally used pigeons for meat. In the early 19th century, commercial hunters began netting and shooting the birds to sell in city markets as food, as live targets for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_shooting" title="Trap shooting">trap shooting</a>, and even as agricultural <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizer</a>.
Once pigeon meat became popular, commercial hunting started on a prodigious scale. Painter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Audubon" title="John James Audubon">John James Audubon</a> described the preparations for slaughter at a known pigeon-roosting site:
Few pigeons were then to be seen, but a great number of persons, with horses and wagons, guns and ammunition, had already established encampments on the borders. Two farmers from the vicinity of Russelsville, distant more than a hundred miles, had driven upwards of three hundred hogs to be fattened on the pigeons which were to be slaughtered. Here and there, the people employed in plucking and salting what had already been procured, were seen sitting in the midst of large piles of these birds. The dung lay several inches deep, covering the whole extent of the roosting-place.<sup id="cite_ref-Audubon_33-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Audubon-33"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup>
Pigeons were shipped by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxcar" title="Boxcar">boxcar</a> to the eastern cities. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, in 1805, a pair of pigeons sold for two cents. Slaves and servants in 18th- and 19th-century America often saw no other meat. By the 1850s, the numbers of birds seemed to be decreasing, but still the slaughter continued, accelerating to an even greater level as more railroads were developed after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>.
Alcohol-soaked grain intoxicated the birds and made them easier to kill.

Another significant reason for its extinction was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>.

Wonderfully prolific, having the vast forests of the North as its breeding grounds, traveling hundreds of miles in search of food, it is here today and elsewhere tomorrow, and no ordinary destruction can lessen them, or be missed from the myriads that are yearly produced."<sup id="cite_ref-Endangered_38-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Endangered-38"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup>
Conservationists were ineffective in stopping the slaughter. A bill was passed in the Michigan legislature making it illegal to net pigeons within two miles (3&nbsp;km) of a nesting area, but the law was weakly enforced. By the mid 1890s, the Passenger Pigeon almost completely disappeared. In 1897, a bill was introduced in the Michigan legislature asking for a 10-year closed season on Passenger Pigeons. This was a futile gesture. Similar legal measures were passed and disregarded in Pennsylvania.<sup id="cite_ref-Ehrlich_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ehrlich-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> This was a highly gregarious species &nbsp;–  the flock could initiate courtship and reproduction only when they were gathered in large numbers; smaller groups of Passenger Pigeons could not breed successfully, and the surviving numbers proved too few to re-establish the species.<sup id="cite_ref-SI_25-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SI-25"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Attempts at breeding among the captive population also failed for the same reasons. The passenger pigeon was a colonial and gregarious bird practicing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_roosting" title="Communal roosting">communal roosting</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_breeding" title="Communal breeding" class="mw-redirect">communal breeding</a> and needed large numbers for optimum breeding conditions.
By the turn of the 20th century, the last group of passenger pigeons, all descended from the same pair, was kept by Professor Charles O. Whitman at the University of Chicago.<sup id="cite_ref-Rothschild_46-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rothschild-46"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> The last attempt to breed the remaining specimens was done by Whitman and the Cincinnati Zoo, which included attempts at making a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_dove" title="Rock dove" class="mw-redirect">rock dove</a> foster Passenger Pigeon eggs.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> Whitman sent Martha, which was to be the last known specimen, to Cincinnati Zoo in 1902.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup>

Speaking on May 11, 1947, Leopold remarked:

The naturalist Charles Dury, of Cincinnati, Ohio, wrote in September 1910: "One foggy day in October 1884, at 5 a.m. I looked out of my bedroom window, and as I looked six wild pigeons flew down and perched on the dead branches of a tall poplar tree that stood about one hundred feet away. As I gazed at them in delight, feeling as though old friends had come back, they quickly darted away and disappeared in the fog, the last I ever saw of any of these birds in this vicinity."<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup>
