The <b>Ringed Kingfisher</b> (<i>Megaceryle torquata</i>) is a large, conspicuous and noisy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingfisher" title="Kingfisher">kingfisher</a>, commonly found along the lower <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_River" title="Rio Grande River" class="mw-redirect">Rio Grande River</a> valley in southeasternmost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tierra_del_Fuego" title="Tierra del Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>.
The breeding habitat is areas near large bodies of water, usually in heavily wooded areas where it finds a perch to hunt from. It is mostly a sedentary species, remaining in territories all year long.
It is 40–41&nbsp;cm long, with deep blue or bluish-gray <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> with white markings, a shaggy crest and a broad white collar around the neck. Its most distinguishing characteristic is the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufous" title="Rufous">rufous</a> belly, which also covers the entire breast of the male. Females are more colorful than the male (i.e., reverse sexual dimorphism) and have a bluish-gray breast and a narrow white stripe separating the breast from the belly.
These birds nest in a horizontal tunnel made in a river bank or sand bank. The female lays 3 to 6 eggs. Both parents excavate the tunnel, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubate_(bird)" title="Incubate (bird)" class="mw-redirect">incubate</a> the eggs and feed the young.
It is often seen perched prominently on trees, posts, or other suitable "watchpoints" close to water before plunging in head first after its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> prey. They also eat small mammals, insects, small reptiles and berries.
Their voice is a loud, penetrating rattle given on the wing and when perched.
