The <b>White-tipped Dove</b> (<i>Leptotila verreauxi</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World" title="New World">New World</a> tropical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dove" title="Dove" class="mw-redirect">dove</a>. It is a resident breeder from the southernmost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" title="USA" class="mw-redirect">USA</a> through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> south to western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a> and central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>. It also breeds on the offshore islands of northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago" title="Trinidad and Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_Antilles" title="Netherlands Antilles">Netherlands Antilles</a>. Numerous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> exist; some of the more widespread are the nominate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon" title="Taxon">taxon</a>, <i>L. v. verreauxi</i>, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, <i>L. v. angelica</i> from Texas and coastal Mexico, <i>L. v. decolor</i> west of the Andes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> to northern Peru, <i>L. v. brasiliensis</i> in most of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Rainforest" title="Amazon Rainforest" class="mw-redirect">Amazon</a> north of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River" title="Amazon River">Amazon River</a> and <i>L. v. decipiens</i> in a large part of central South America.
The White-tipped Dove inhabits scrub, woodland and forest. It builds a large stick nest in a tree and lays two white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>. Incubation is about 14 days, and fledging another 15.
The White-tipped Dove has an approx. length of 28&nbsp;cm (11&nbsp;in) and a weight of 155 g (5Â½ oz). Adult birds of most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(biology)" title="Race (biology)">races</a> have a grey tinge from the crown to the nape, a pale grey or whitish forehead and a whitish throat. The eye-ring is typically red in most of its range, but blue in most of the Amazon and northern South America. The upperparts and wings are grey-brown, and the underparts are whitish shading to pinkish, dull grey or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buff_(colour)" title="Buff (colour)">buff</a> on the chest. The underwing coverts are rufous. The tail is broadly tipped with white, but this is best visible from below or in flight. The bill is black, the legs are red and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" title="Iris (anatomy)">iris</a> is yellow.
The White-tipped Dove resembles the closely related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey-fronted_Dove" title="Grey-fronted Dove">Grey-fronted Dove</a>, <i>Leptotila rufaxilla</i>, which prefers humid forest habitats. The best distinctions are the greyer forehead and crown, which contrast less with the hindcrown than in the Grey-fronted Dove. In the area of overlap, the White-tipped Dove usually has a blue (not red) eye-ring, but this is not reliable in some parts of Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, where it typically is red in both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a>.
The White-tipped Dove is usually seen singly or in pairs, and is rather wary. Its flight is fast and direct, with the regular beats and clattering of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general.
The food of this species is mainly seeds obtained by foraging on the ground, but it will also take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a>, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly" title="Butterfly">butterflies</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth" title="Moth">moths</a>. The call is a deep hollow <i>ooo-wooooo</i>.
The scientific name of this bird commemorates the French naturalists <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verreaux" title="Jules Verreaux">Jules</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edouard_Verreaux" title="Edouard Verreaux" class="mw-redirect">Edouard Verreaux</a>.
