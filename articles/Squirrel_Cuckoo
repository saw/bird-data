The <b>Squirrel Cuckoo</b> (<i>Piaya cayana</i>) is a large and active species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo" title="Cuckoo">cuckoo</a> found in wooded habitats from northwestern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, and on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>.
This large and extremely long-tailed cuckoo is 40.5–50 centimetres (15.9–20 in) long and weighs 95–120 grams (3.4–4.2 oz).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The adult has mainly chestnut upperparts and head, becoming paler on the throat. The lower breast is grey and the belly is blackish. The central tail feathers are rufous, but the outer are black with white tips. The bill is yellow and the iris is red. Immature birds have a grey bill and eyering, brown iris, and less white in the tail. It resembles the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Cuckoo" title="Little Cuckoo">Little Cuckoo</a>, but that species is smaller and has a darker throat
There are a number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a> with minor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> variations. For example, <i>P. c. mehleri</i>, one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South American</a> subspecies, has mainly brown (not black) outer tail feathers. Additionally, the subspecies from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>, and northern and western South America have a yellow eye-ring, but this is red in the remaining part of South America.
It makes explosive <i>kip!</i> and <i>kip! weeuu</i> calls, and the song is a whistled <i>wheep wheep wheep wheep</i>.
The Squirrel Cuckoo is found in woodland canopy and edges, second growth, hedges and semi-open habitats from sea level to as high as 2,500 metres (8,200&nbsp;ft), although it is uncommon above 1,200 metres (3,900&nbsp;ft). This species’ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> name derives from its habit of running along branches and leaping from branch to branch like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel" title="Squirrel">squirrel</a>. It normally flies only short distances, mainly gliding with an occasional flap.
It feeds on large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada" title="Cicada">cicadas</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasp" title="Wasp">wasps</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar" title="Caterpillar">caterpillars</a> (including those with stinging hairs or spines), and occasionally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a> and small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard" title="Lizard">lizards</a>, rarely taking fruit.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Its static prey is typically taken off the foliage with a quick lunge, but wasps may be picked out of the air. Squirrel Cuckoos are often observed to forage peacefully alongside small mammals such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Marmoset" title="Common Marmoset" class="mw-redirect">Common Marmosets</a> (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season" title="Dry season">dry season</a> for cocoa beans. In particular, they can be seen to attend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_ant" title="Army ant">army ant</a> columns together, picking off prey flushed by the ants, and occasionally will join <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-species_feeding_flock" title="Mixed-species feeding flock" class="mw-redirect">mixed-species feeding flocks</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
The nest is a cup of leaves on a twig foundation, hidden in dense vegetation 1–12 metres (3.3–39 ft) high in a tree. The female lays two white eggs.
The Squirrel Cuckoo is plentiful in most of its range and appears to be quite tolerant of human disturbance, as long as wooded land remains.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Compared to many cuckoos in the world, it is relatively bold and conspicuous, although it most often encountered skulking about within vegetation. Due to its wide range, it is considered a species of Least Concern by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" title="IUCN" class="mw-redirect">IUCN</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
