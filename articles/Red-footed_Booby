<i>Sula piscator</i>
The <b>Red-footed Booby</b> (<i>Sula sula</i>) is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird" title="Seabird">seabird</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booby" title="Booby">booby</a> family, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulidae" title="Sulidae">Sulidae</a>. As suggested by the name, adults always have red feet, but the colour of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> varies. They are powerful and agile fliers, but they are clumsy in takeoffs and landings. They are found widely in the tropics, and breed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_colony" title="Bird colony">colonially</a> in coastal regions, especially islands.
The Red-footed Booby is the smallest of all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booby" title="Booby">boobies</a> at about 70 centimetres (28&nbsp;in) in length and with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingspan" title="Wingspan">wingspan</a> of up to 1 metre (3.3&nbsp;ft). It has red legs, and its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak" title="Beak">bill</a> and throat pouch are coloured pink and blue. This species has several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)" title="Polymorphism (biology)">morphs</a>. In the white morph the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage" title="Plumage">plumage</a> is mostly white (the head often tinged yellowish) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather" title="Flight feather">flight feathers</a> are black. The black-tailed white morph is similar, but with a black tail, and can easily be confused with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_Booby" title="Nazca Booby">Nazca</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked_Booby" title="Masked Booby">Masked Boobies</a>. The brown morph is overall brown. The white-tailed brown morph is similar, but has a white belly, rump, and tail. The white-headed and white-tailed brown morph has a mostly white body, tail and head, and brown wings and back. The morphs commonly breed together, but in most regions one or two morphs predominates; e.g. at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands" title="Galápagos Islands">Galápagos Islands</a>, most belong to the brown morph, though the white morph also occurs.
The sexes are similar, and juveniles are brownish with darker wings, and pale pinkish legs, while chicks are covered in dense white down.
This species breeds on islands in most tropical oceans. When not breeding it spends most of the time at sea, and is therefore rarely seen away from breeding colonies. It nests in large colonies, laying one chalky blue egg in a stick nest, which is incubated by both adults for 44–46 days. The nest is usually placed in a tree or bush, but rarely it may nest on the ground. It may be three months before the young first fly, and five months before they make extensive flights.
Red-footed Booby pairs may remain together over several seasons. They perform elaborate greeting rituals, including harsh squawks and the male's display of his blue throat, also including short dances.
Red-footed Boobies are spectacular divers, plunging into the ocean at high speeds to catch prey. They mainly eat small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid" title="Squid">squid</a> which gather in groups near the surface.
